        "text": "{'content': \"The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has announced that over 1.9 million taxpayers will benefit from the No-Filing Service (NFS) for the tax season in 2025. This service simplifies the tax filing process for eligible individuals, allowing them to avoid filing income tax returns. To qualify for the NFS, taxpayers must have income solely from employment and not exceed a certain threshold. IRAS will automatically assess their income and tax obligations based on available information. The NFS aims to reduce the administrative burden on taxpayers and streamline the tax assessment process. Eligible taxpayers will receive a notification from IRAS regarding their tax assessment, which they can review and accept without needing to file a return. This initiative is part of IRAS's efforts to enhance taxpayer experience and promote compliance with tax obligations in Singapore. Taxpayers on the NFS will receive a notification of their status by March 2025. They are reminded to verify pre-filled information in their return, especially for reliefs based on the previous year's tax bill, due to changes in criteria for dependant-related tax reliefs effective from YA 2025. The filing deadline for individual taxpayers and partnerships is 18 April 2025. Tax resident individuals will automatically receive a 60% rebate on tax payable, capped at $200. Close to 500,000 taxpayers will receive their tax bills earlier from mid-March 2025 through the Direct Notice of Assessment (D-NOA) initiative. Changes to dependant-related tax reliefs have been announced, including raising the income threshold for certain reliefs. The Working Mother\u2019s Child Relief (WMCR) will also change to a fixed dollar amount for qualifying children born or adopted on or after 1 January 2024. Taxpayers are encouraged to use secured digital payment methods for tax payments and to be vigilant against scams. For assistance, taxpayers can contact IRAS through various channels, and more information is available on their website.\", 'urls': ['https://www.iras.gov.sg']}",

Chaired by Mr. Chee Hong Tat, Minister for Transport, Second Minister for Finance, and Deputy Chairman of MAS, the group includes key private sector stakeholders and public sector representatives.\n\nThe Review Group has made tax-related recommendations to the Government to encourage new listings in Singapore and increase investment demand for Singapore-listed equities. The Government has accepted these recommendations and will introduce three tax incentives:\n\n(A) Listing Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Rebate for new corporate listings in Singapore;  \n(B) Enhanced concessionary tax rate (CTR) for new fund manager listings in Singapore;  \n(C) Tax exemption on fund managers\u2019 qualifying income arising from funds investing substantially in Singapore-listed equities.\n\n(B) and (C) are enhancements to the Financial Sector Incentive \u2013 Fund Management (FSI-FM), which currently awards a CTR of 10% on qualifying income derived by fund managers in Singapore from the provision of fund management and investment advisory services.\n\nThe Review Group will provide more details on its recommendations after Budget 2025.\n\n(A) Listing Corporate Income Tax Rebate for New Corporate Listings in Singapore\n\nTo encourage companies to raise public capital and grow their economic activities in Singapore, qualifying entities may apply for a 10% or 20% Listing CIT Rebate. \n\nQualifying entities include companies and registered business trusts that are tax residents in Singapore. The tax benefits are as follows: primary listings receive a 20% CIT rebate, while secondary listings (with share issuance) receive a 10% CIT rebate. There is a rebate cap of $6 million per Year of Assessment (YA) for qualifying entities with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion, and $3 million per YA for those with a market capitalization of less than $1 billion.\n\nTo qualify, entities must achieve a primary or secondary listing on a Singapore exchange and remain listed for 5 years. They must also commit to incremental local business spending or fixed asset investments, and incremental skilled employment by the end of the award tenure. The scheme duration is 5 years per qualifying entity and is non-renewable. It is open for award until 31 December 2027. Interested entities can approach EDB or EnterpriseSG for more details.\n\n(B) Enhanced CTR for New Fund Manager Listings in Singapore\n\nTo enhance Singapore\u2019s value proposition to fund managers seeking to scale up their activities via public fundraising and grow their investment activities in Singapore, an enhanced CTR tier of 5% will be introduced under the FSI-FM for newly listed fund managers.\n\nQualifying entities are Singapore fund managers, who will receive a 5% CTR on qualifying income. To qualify, the fund manager or its holding company must achieve a primary listing on a Singapore exchange and remain listed for 5 years. The fund manager must distribute a portion of its profits as dividends and meet minimum requirements for professional headcount and assets under management (AUM). The award tenure is 5 years per fund manager and is non-renewable. It is open for award until 31 December 2028. Interested fund managers can approach MAS for more details.\n\n(C) Tax Exemption on Fund Managers\u2019 Qualifying Income Arising from Funds Investing Substantially in Singapore-Listed Equities\n\nTo support fund managers in launching and managing qualifying funds that invest substantially in Singapore-listed equities, a corporate tax exemption on income arising from such funds will be introduced under the FSI-FM.\n\nQualifying entities are Singapore fund managers who will receive a tax exemption on qualifying income. Fund managers must meet minimum professional headcount and AUM requirements. Qualifying funds must meet the following criteria: for new funds, at least 30% of AUM must be invested in Singapore-listed equities; for existing funds, at least 30% of AUM must be invested in Singapore-listed equities, and annual net subscriptions (i.e., subscriptions less redemptions) must be equivalent to at least 5% of the fund\u2019s AUM in the preceding year.\n\nThe qualifying income includes fees earned from fund management and investment advisory activities related to the qualifying funds. The award tenure is 5 years per fund managed by the fund manager and is non-renewable. It is open for award until 31 December 2028. Interested fund managers can approach MAS for more details.\n\nFor more information, please contact EnterpriseSG at +65 6898 1800 or through their enquiry and feedback form, or EDB at client_services@edb.gov.sg.

SC seniors will be able to claim the vouchers first, followed by all other SC adults. The SG60 Vouchers will expire on 31 December 2026.\n\nIn terms of claiming and spending, the SG60 Vouchers will have the same user experience as the Community Development Council (\u201cCDC\u201d) Vouchers:\n\n\u2022 Claim: The SG60 Vouchers can be claimed digitally on RedeemSG via Singpass. SCs who are unable to claim their vouchers digitally can approach their nearest Community Centres/Clubs for assistance to claim the vouchers.\n\n\u2022 Spend: The SG60 Vouchers can be used at all businesses that accept the CDC Vouchers. Half of the SG60 Vouchers will be allocated for spending at participating heartland merchants and hawkers, while the other half will be allocated for spending at participating supermarkets.\n\nThe SG60 Vouchers will benefit about three million SC adults. More details will be released subsequently by the People\u2019s Association and the CDCs.\n\nPersonal Income Tax Rebate\n\nThe Government will provide a Personal Income Tax (\u201cPIT\u201d) Rebate of 60% of tax payable for all tax resident individuals for the Year of Assessment (\u201cYA\u201d) 2025 (i.e., for income earned in 2024).\n\nThe rebate will be capped at $200 per taxpayer. The $200 cap ensures that the PIT Rebate mostly benefits middle-income workers.\n\nNo application for the PIT Rebate is required. IRAS will compute and grant the rebate automatically to all tax resident individuals.\n\nFor more information on your PIT Rebate, you may refer to your tax bill for YA 2025. Most taxpayers should receive their tax bills between April to September 2025.\n\nSG60 Baby Gift\n\nTo celebrate the joy and significance of parenthood, the Government will provide an SG60 Baby Gift for all SC babies born in 2025.\n\nMore details will be provided at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office\u2019s Committee of Supply.\n\n(B) SG60 Rental Support for Hawker Centre and Market Stallholders\n\nTo mark the fifth anniversary of the inscription of Hawker Culture onto the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, the Government will provide a one-time SG60 Rental Support to recognise the important role that hawker centres and markets play in our national identity and heritage.\n\nThe one-time $600 rental support will be extended to each stall in hawker centres and markets managed by Government and Government-appointed operators to appreciate their contributions.\n\nDetails will be released to stallholders by the relevant agencies.\n\n(C) SG Culture Pass\n\nThe SG Culture Pass aims to foster national pride and identity amongst Singaporeans through local arts and heritage.\n\nAll SCs aged 18 years old and above in 2025 will be eligible for $100 SG Culture Pass credits. The SG Culture Pass credits will be valid from 1 September 2025 to 31 December 2028.\n\nThe credits can be used to purchase tickets for eligible local performances, exhibitions, and experiences such as learning tours and participatory workshops, and sold by approved ticketing partners.\n\nMore details on how to claim the SG Culture Pass credits will be released subsequently by MCCY.\n\n(D) SG60 ActiveSG Credit Top-Up\n\nThe SG60 ActiveSG Credit Top-Up aims to encourage broad-based sports participation across different segments of society during SG60.\n\nSCs and Permanent Residents will be eligible for a one-off $100 SG60 ActiveSG Credit Top-Up in June 2025.\n\n\u2022 Existing ActiveSG members will receive the $100 SG60 ActiveSG Credit Top-Up.\n\n\u2022 New ActiveSG members will receive $200 credits \u2013 $100 credits from the existing new member incentive scheme implemented in 2014 and the $100 SG60 ActiveSG Credit Top-Up.\n\nThe credits can be used for fees for ActiveSG facilities and to offset fees for ActiveSG programmes.\n\nMore details will be released at MCCY\u2019s Committee of Supply.\n\n(E) Measures to Encourage Philanthropy\n\nThe Government and Tote Board will set aside more than $600 million in matching funds to strengthen our spirit of giving.\n\nTop-up to the Cultural Matching Fund\n\nThe Cultural Matching Fund (\u201cCMF\u201d) aims to encourage broad-based cultural philanthropy through the provision of dollar-for-dollar matching for cash donations to eligible arts and heritage charities.\n\nTo encourage continued giving to the arts and heritage sector, the Government will provide a $100 million top-up to the CMF and extend it for five years till end-FY 2029.\n\nTote Board\u2019s Enhanced Fund-Raising Programme\n\nSince FY 2020, the Government and Tote Board has provided dollar-for-dollar matching support, capped at $250,000 per year per charity for eligible fund-raisers for local charitable causes. This dollar-for-dollar matching support was intended to provide exceptional support for charities during Covid-19.\n\nTo provide our charities continued support, especially during SG60, the Government and Tote Board will provide a $270 million top-up and extend the Enhanced Fund-Raising (\u201cEFR\u201d) Programme for three years until end-FY 2027.\n\nSpecifically, we will maintain the existing dollar-for-dollar matching support levels in FY 2025, halve the support level in FY 2026, and return to pre-Covid-19 levels in FY 2027. Refer to Table 3 for more details. Such an approach will provide charities sufficient time to adjust their fund-raising plans.\n\nTable 3: The Government\u2019s and Tote Board\u2019s Matching Support for the EFR Programme from FY 2006 to FY 2027\n\nEFR Matching Support\n\nFY 2006 to FY 2019\n\nFY 2020 to FY 2024\n\nFY 2025\n\nFY 2026\n\nFY 2027\n\nTote Board\n\n20% of funds raised, to up $50,000 per application.  \n\nGovernment Nil.  \n\n40% of funds raised, up to $100,000 per application and up to five applications per charity per FY.  \n60% of funds raised, up to $150,000 per charity per FY.  \n\n40% of funds raised, up to $100,000 per application and up to five applications per charity per FY.  \n60% of funds raised, up to $150,000 per charity per FY.  \n\n20% of funds raised, up to $50,000 per application and up to five applications per charity per FY.  \n30% of funds raised, up to $75,000 per charity per FY.  \nNil.  \n\nCommitted Budget (from FY 2025 to FY 2027)\n\n$170 million  \n\n$100 million  \n\nNotes:  \nIn celebration of Tote Board\u2019s 30th anniversary in FY 2018, there was a one-off matching at 40% of funds raised, up to $100,000 per application.  \nFive applications per charity cap introduced from FY 2021 onwards.  \n\nCharities can also leverage broad-based support schemes by the Government, such as 250% tax deductions for qualifying donations to Institutions of a Public Character, as well as the Charities Capabilities Fund which provides funding support to enhance the governance and management capabilities of charities.\n\nSG Gives Matching Grant\n\nThe SG Gives matching grant will be introduced to galvanise Singaporeans to contribute to social and community programmes, aligning with the SG60 theme of \u201cBuilding Our Singapore Together\u201d which rallies Singaporeans to contribute to the next chapter of nation building and commit to building a shared future together.\n\nThrough the SG Gives matching grant, donations made to eligible social and community programmes through the Community Chest (ComChest), President\u2019s Challenge, and the Collective for a Stronger Society, will be matched by the Government up to $250 million. For every dollar donation made in 2025, it will be matched with an equivalent dollar. To encourage sustained giving, donations of $250,000 or more per year over three years will be matched with $1.50 for every dollar. Refer to Tables 4 and 5 for more details.\n\nProgrammes that will benefit from matching grant include KidSTART, ComLink+, New Life Stories\u2019 Family Strengthening Programme, and 3Pumpkins\u2019 Tak Takut Kids Club.\n\nTable 4: Parameters of General and Enhanced Matching\n\nMatching ratio  \nEligibility period  \n\nGeneral matching  \n$1 Government matching for every dollar donated  \n1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025  \n\nRequirements  \n\nNo minimum donation amount or commitment period  \n\nEnhanced matching  \nUp to $1.50 Government matching for every dollar donated  \n1 January 2025 to 31 December 2027  \nDonations of at least $250,000 each year, for a three-year commitment period  \n\nTable 5: Illustration of General and Enhanced Matching\n\nCorresponding Matching Grant  \n\nDonation  \n\n2025  \n\n2026  \n\n2027  \n\nEligibility  \n\nTotal matching  \n\nTotal funds  \n\nDonor A  \n\nDonor B  \n\n$250,000  \n\n$0  \n\n$0  \n\n$250,000  \n\n$250,000  \n\n$250,000  \n\nEligible for 1:1 matching for donation made in 2025  \nEligible for 1.5:1 matching for donations made in 2025-2027  \n\n$250,000  \n\n$500,000  \n\n$1,125,000  \n\n$1,875,000  \n\n(F) Additional Grants to Self-Help Groups\n\nThe Government will provide additional grants of $60 million over five years to SHGs to enhance their programming and enable them to better support their communities.

This may not necessarily be the case when two related parties transact with each other. It is important to the integrity of the tax system that the price for the transaction between related parties approximates to the market price.\n\nTo prevent price distortion, tax authorities may audit the prices of transactions between related parties to verify if they are reflective of market prices. Such audit can lead to transfer pricing adjustments bringing about double taxation.\n\nTo reduce the risk of audits and double taxation, when transacting with their related parties, taxpayers should ensure the transfer price between them is arm\u2019s length as if they were unrelated parties negotiating freely. Taxpayers should also maintain proper transfer pricing documentation to demonstrate that the pricing is arm\u2019s length.\n\nIf taxpayers are faced with double taxation, they may apply for a mutual agreement procedure with their tax authorities under the DTA provisions to eliminate double taxation. They may also apply for an advance pricing arrangement to agree in advance with one or more tax authorities the appropriate transfer pricing for their related party transactions for a period of time.\n\nGlossary\n\nAdvance pricing arrangement\n\nThis is an arrangement between IRAS and the taxpayer or the relevant foreign competent authority to agree in advance an appropriate set of criteria to ascertain the transfer pricing for a taxpayer\u2019s related party transactions for a specific period of time.\n\nArm\u2019s length principle\n\nThe arm\u2019s length principle is the international standard to guide transfer pricing. It requires the transaction with a related party to be made under comparable conditions and circumstances as a transaction with an independent party.\n\nArm\u2019s length range\n\nA range of prices or margins that is acceptable for establishing that the conditions of a related party transaction are arm\u2019s length.\n\nComparability analysis\n\nThe process of identifying economically relevant characteristics in a related party transaction and comparing such characteristics with those in independent party transactions. This involves an examination of the factors affecting the related party transaction that are non-existent in transactions between independent parties and vice-versa.\n\nComparable independent party transaction\n\nA comparable independent party transaction is a transaction between two independent parties that is comparable to the related party transaction under examination. It can be either a comparable transaction between one party which is a party to the related party transaction and two independent parties, neither of which is a party to the related party transaction (\u201cexternal comparable\u201d) or between independent party transactions (\u201cinternal comparable\u201d).\n\nComparable uncontrolled price (\u201cCUP\u201d) method\n\nA transfer pricing method that compares the price for properties or services transferred in a related party transaction to the price charged for properties or services transferred in an independent party transaction in comparable circumstances.\n\nCompetent Authority\n\nThis refers to a person or an organisation that has been appointed or delegated to perform a designated function. IRAS is the designated competent authority for matters relating to transfer pricing, which include advance pricing arrangement and mutual agreement procedure.\n\nContribution analysis\n\nAn analysis used in the transactional profit split method under which the total profit earned by the parties from a related party transaction is divided based on the parties\u2019 relative contributions to the earning of that profit.\n\nCorresponding adjustment\n\nWhen a tax authority increases a taxpayer\u2019s taxable profits as a result of applying the arm\u2019s length principle to the taxpayer\u2019s transactions with its related party in another jurisdiction, double taxation arises if the same profits have been or will be included in the tax base of the related party. To eliminate the double taxation, the tax authority in the other jurisdiction may agree to reduce the taxable profits of that related party. Such a downward adjustment to the related party\u2019s taxable profit is known as corresponding adjustment.\n\nCost plus method\n\nA transfer pricing method where a comparable gross mark up is added to the costs incurred by the supplier of goods or services in a related party transaction to arrive at the arm\u2019s length price of that transaction.\n\nDirect costs\n\nCosts that are incurred specifically for producing a product or providing a service, such as the cost of raw materials.\n\nDouble taxation\n\nWhere two or more tax authorities take different positions in determining arm\u2019s length prices, double taxation may occur. Double taxation means that the same income is included in the tax base by two or more tax authorities, but this does not always mean that the income will actually be taxed twice.\n\nDTA (or Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement)\n\nDTA refers to agreements between governments for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion of income taxes or commonly known as tax treaties.\n\nFAR\n\nFAR refers to Functions performed, Assets used and Risks assumed.\n\nFunctional analysis\n\nA functional analysis seeks to identify the economically significant activities and responsibilities undertaken, assets used or contributed, and risks assumed by the parties to the transactions.\n\nGross profits\n\nThe amount computed by deducting from the gross receipts of a business transaction the allocable purchases or production costs of sales, with due adjustment for increases or decreases in inventory or stock-in-trade, but without taking account of other expenses.\n\nIndependent parties (or unrelated parties)\n\nTwo parties are independent (or unrelated) parties with respect to each other if they are not related parties with respect to each other.\n\nIndependent (or unrelated) party transactions\n\nTransactions between independent (or unrelated) parties.\n\nIndirect costs\n\nCosts of producing a product or service which, although closely related to the production process, may be common to several products or services (for example, the costs of a repair department that services equipment used to produce different products).\n\nITA\n\nITA refers to the Income Tax Act 1947.\n\nMutual agreement procedure\n\nThis is a facility through which IRAS and the relevant foreign competent authority resolve disputes regarding the application of DTAs.\n\nNet profit indicator (or profit level indicator)\n\nThe ratio of net profit to an appropriate base (for example, costs, sales, assets) as used in the transactional net margin method.\n\nOECD TPG\n\nOECD TPG refers to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations.\n\nRelated party\n\nTwo persons are related parties with respect to each other if:\n\n(a) Either person, directly or indirectly, controls the other person; or\n\n(b) Both persons are, directly or indirectly, controlled by a common person.\n\nThe exact wordings of the definition are provided under Section 2 of the ITA.\n\nRelated party transactions\n\nTransactions between related parties.\n\nResale price margin\n\nA margin representing the amount out of which a reseller would seek to cover its selling and other operating expenses and, in the light of the functions performed (taking into account assets used and risks assumed), make an appropriate profit.\n\nResale price method\n\nA transfer pricing method where the resale price to the independent party is reduced by a comparable resale price margin to arrive at the arm\u2019s length price of the product transferred between the related parties.\n\nResidual analysis\n\nAn analysis used in the transactional profit split method under which the total profit earned by the parties from a related party transaction is split in two stages: firstly, by determining the return for readily identifiable functions attributed to each party involved and secondly, by dividing the residual profit.\n\nSelf-initiated retrospective adjustments\n\nDue to subsequent changes in circumstances, some taxpayers may review their past transfer prices relating to the transactions with their related parties. Arising from such review, they may decide to make retrospective upward or downward adjustments for past financial years to arrive at what, in the taxpayers\u2019 opinion, would be the arm\u2019s length prices. These adjustments are referred to as self-initiated retrospective adjustments.\n\nTested party\n\nThe use of resale price method, cost plus method or transactional net margin method requires a decision on which party to apply the transfer pricing analysis. This party is known as the tested party. Generally, the tested party is the one where a transfer pricing method can be applied in the most reliable manner and most reliable comparables can be found.\n\nTP Documentation Rules\n\nTP Documentation Rules refers to the Income Tax (Transfer Pricing Documentation) Rules 2018.\n\nTraditional transaction methods\n\nTransfer pricing methods that compare the prices of related party transactions with those of transactions between independent parties, namely the comparable uncontrolled price method, the resale price method, and the cost plus method.\n\nTransactional net margin method (\u201cTNMM\u201d)\n\nA transfer pricing method that compares the net profit relative to an appropriate base (for example, costs, sales, assets) that is attained by a taxpayer from a related party transaction to that of comparable independent parties.\n\nTransactional profit methods\n\nTransfer pricing methods that compare the profits arising from related party transactions with those generated in independent party transactions, such as the transactional net margin method and transactional profit split method.\n\nTransactional profit split method\n\nA transfer pricing method that is based on the concept of splitting the combined profits of a transaction between related parties in a similar way as how independent parties would under comparable circumstances.\n\nTransfer pricing adjustment\n\nIn the event the related parties do not transact with each other at arm\u2019s length prices, tax authorities may for tax purposes, substitute the price of the transaction with one that could have been charged if the parties were unrelated. The adjustment to arrive at that price is known as a transfer pricing adjustment.\n\nYA\n\nYA refers to year of assessment.\n\nYear-end adjustments\n\nAdjustments which taxpayers made to their actual results at the year-end closing of their accounts to arrive at what, in the taxpayers\u2019 opinion, would be the arm\u2019s length prices for their related party transactions as described in their transfer pricing analyses and policies.\n\nPART I \u2013 TRANSFER PRICING PRINCIPLES AND FUNDAMENTALS\n\nBackground\n\nTransfer pricing refers to the rules and methods for pricing transactions between related parties. Such transactions can be sale or purchase of goods, provision of services, borrowing or lending of money, use or transfer of intangibles, etc.\n\nTwo persons are related parties with respect to each other if:\n\n(a) Either person, directly or indirectly, controls the other person; or\n\n(b) Both persons are, directly or indirectly, controlled by a common person.\n\nWhere a non-resident person carries on a business through a permanent establishment in Singapore, for the purpose of attributing profits to the permanent establishment:\n\n(a) The permanent establishment in Singapore of that person; and\n\n(b) Other permanent establishments outside Singapore of that person\n\nare treated as separate and distinct persons. They are considered related parties and accordingly the arm\u2019s length principle applies to them when attributing profits to the permanent establishment in Singapore.\n\nWhen related parties transact with each other, their pricing may not reflect market conditions due to a lack of independence in their commercial and financial relations. As a result, their profits and tax liabilities may be distorted, especially when they are located in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. This creates concerns that the related parties may not be paying their fair share of tax and are able to derive a tax advantage as a group.\n\nTo ensure taxpayers transact with their related parties at pricing that reflects independent pricing, IRAS applies the internationally endorsed arm\u2019s length principle. If taxpayers do not comply with the arm\u2019s length principle and have understated their profits, IRAS will adjust their profits upwards as provided in the Income Tax Act 1947 (\u201cITA\u201d).\n\nForeign tax authorities will likewise make upward adjustments when they find the transfer pricing of the cross-border related party transactions is not at arm\u2019s length. Such transfer pricing adjustments, by IRAS or the foreign tax authorities, may lead to double taxation.\n\nThus, it is important that taxpayers comply with the arm\u2019s length principle when transacting with their related parties and maintain proper transfer pricing documentation to substantiate their pricing.\n\nIRAS generally takes guidance from the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (\u201cOECD TPG\u201d).\n\nThe arm\u2019s length principle\n\nIntroduction\n\nIRAS endorses the arm\u2019s length principle as the standard to guide transfer pricing. IRAS subscribes to the principle that profits should be taxed where the real economic activities generating the profits are performed and where value is created. A proper application of the transfer pricing rules would ensure this outcome.\n\nThis section covers the following:\n\n(a) What the arm\u2019s length principle is;\n\n(b) Basis for the arm\u2019s length principle;\n\n(c) Reasons for endorsing the arm\u2019s length principle;\n\n(d) Guiding principles on applying the arm\u2019s length principle; and\n\n(e) Three-step approach to apply the arm\u2019s length principle.\n\nWhat the arm\u2019s length principle is\n\nThe arm\u2019s length principle requires a transaction with a related party to be made under comparable conditions and circumstances as a transaction with an independent party. The premise is that where market forces drive the terms and conditions agreed in an independent party transaction, the pricing of the transaction would reflect the true economic value of the contributions made by each party in that transaction.\n\nTherefore, if two related parties derive profits at levels above or below the comparable market level solely because of their special relationship, the profits will be deemed as non-arm\u2019s length. In such a case, IRAS can make necessary adjustments to the taxable profits of the taxpayer in Singapore. This is to reflect the true price that would be derived on an arm\u2019s length basis.\n\nBasis for the arm\u2019s length principle\n\nSection 34D of the ITA stipulates the use of the arm\u2019s length principle for related party transactions, i.e. the conditions made or imposed between related parties with regard to their transaction are those conditions which would be made or imposed if they were not related parties and dealing independently with one another in comparable circumstances (\u201carm\u2019s length conditions\u201d).\n\nThe concept or use of the principle is also implied or referred to in various provisions of the ITA, including Sections 32 and 53.\n\nThe arm\u2019s length principle is found in all of Singapore\u2019s DTAs, typically in:\n\n(a) Paragraph 2 of the Business Profits Article\n\nWhen attributing profits in a contracting state/party to a permanent establishment in that state/party, the permanent establishment should be considered as \u201ca separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions\u201d.\n\n(b) Paragraph 1 of the Associated Enterprises Article\n\n\u201cWhere\u2026conditions are made or imposed between\u2026two [associated] enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe DTA requires the application of the arm\u2019s length principle not only between associated enterprises but also between a permanent establishment of a person in Singapore and other permanent establishments of that person outside Singapore. The profits attributable to the permanent establishment in Singapore are the profits that the permanent establishment would have derived if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions.\n\nReasons for endorsing the arm\u2019s length principle\n\nIRAS endorses the use of the arm\u2019s length principle for two main reasons:\n\n(a) Market forces of supply and demand are the best way to allocate resources and reward effort. Applying the arm\u2019s length principle would result in related and independent party transactions being treated equally for tax purposes.\n\n(b) Most tax jurisdictions adopt the arm\u2019s length principle. In doing so, taxpayers and tax authorities will have a common basis to deal with related party transactions. This should reduce the incidence of transfer pricing adjustments and improve the resolution of transfer pricing disputes. Consequently, the likelihood of double taxation will be reduced.\n\nGuiding principles on applying the arm\u2019s length principle\n\nIRAS recognises that the application of the arm\u2019s length principle is not without difficulties. For instance:\n\n(a) Certain business structures and arrangements are complicated and unique, and may rarely be encountered between independent parties. The lack of comparable conditions established between independent parties makes it difficult to apply the arm\u2019s length principle.\n\n(b) Establishing the arm\u2019s length principle may require substantial analysis of large volume of data and information. Some information may not be readily available or may be of a confidential nature that cannot be disclosed without revealing business secrets.\n\n(c) It may also be costly for taxpayers to perform comprehensive analyses in applying the arm\u2019s length principle and prepare sufficient documentation to demonstrate compliance with the arm\u2019s length principle.\n\nTherefore, IRAS adopts the following guiding principles on applying the arm\u2019s length principle:\n\n(a) Transfer pricing is not an exact science. Establishing and demonstrating compliance with the arm\u2019s length principle require the exercise of judgment. Hence, a pragmatic approach would be adopted in ascertaining arm\u2019s length pricing for related party transactions.\n\n(b) IRAS does not expect taxpayers to adhere rigidly to a defined set of rules in order to establish arm\u2019s length pricing. Depending on the facts and circumstances, i.e. where there is a reasonable basis for doing so, taxpayers may determine and demonstrate arm\u2019s length pricing using a different approach from those suggested in this e-Tax guide or complement those approaches suggested in this e-Tax guide.\n\n(c) Taxpayers would have intimate knowledge of the commercial circumstances that their businesses operate in and the economic relationships between various related parties. This puts them in a better position to perform a robust and comprehensive transfer pricing analysis to determine the arm\u2019s length price.\n\n(d) Taxpayers should exert reasonable efforts to undertake a sound transfer pricing analysis. IRAS will consider the transfer prices determined as, prima facie, arm\u2019s length when taxpayers have:\n\n\u2022 Applied the arm\u2019s length principle in their analysis; and\n\n\u2022 Exercised reasonable efforts to comply with the arm\u2019s length principle, i.e. the transfer prices may reasonably be considered to approximate to arm\u2019s length prices.\n\n(e) IRAS welcomes taxpayers to discuss their concerns and difficulties in applying the arm\u2019s length principle. IRAS believes that such consultation and cooperation between taxpayers and IRAS is a mutually beneficial and pragmatic way to assist taxpayers in complying with the arm\u2019s length principle.\n\nThree-step approach to apply the arm\u2019s length principle\n\nIRAS recommends that taxpayers adopt the following three-step approach to apply the arm\u2019s length principle in their related party transactions:\n\nStep 1 - Conduct comparability analysis\n\nStep 2 - Identify the most appropriate transfer pricing method and tested party\n\nStep 3 - Determine the arm\u2019s length results\n\nTransfer pricing analysis always requires an element of judgment. Ultimately, the main objective in any transfer pricing analysis is to present a logical, coherent and consistent basis to demonstrate that transfer prices set between related parties are at arm\u2019s length.\n\nThe recommended three-step approach is neither mandatory nor prescriptive. A taxpayer can modify the recommended approach or adopt an alternative approach if its individual circumstances require such modifications to better arrive at the arm\u2019s length result.\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Conduct comparability analysis\n\nComparability analysis is at the heart of the application of the arm\u2019s length principle. This requires:\n\n(a) Identifying the commercial or financial relations between the related parties and the conditions and economically relevant circumstances attaching to those relations in order that the transaction between the related parties is accurately delineated.\n\n(b) Comparing the conditions and relevant circumstances of the related party transaction as accurately delineated with the conditions and the economically relevant circumstances of comparable transactions between independent parties.\n\nThe comparability analysis conducted under Step 1 will have:\n\n(a) Set out the factual substance of the commercial or financial relations between the related parties and accurately delineated the actual transaction;\n\n(b) Compared the economically relevant characteristics of the actual related party transaction and independent party transactions;\n\n(c) Identified the differences (if any) in the economically relevant characteristics between the related party transaction and the independent party transactions that can materially affect the price of the related party transaction; and\n\n(d) Determined reasonably accurate adjustments that can be made to eliminate the effect of any such differences.\n\nIdentifying the actual related party transaction\n\nThe process of identifying the commercial or financial relations between the related parties and the conditions and economically relevant circumstances attaching to those relations requires:\n\n(a) A broad understanding of the industry sector in which the group operates.\n\n(b) An analysis of what each party does and their commercial or financial relations as expressed in the transaction or transactions between them.\n\n(c) The accurate delineation of the actual transaction or transactions between them.\n\nThe accurate delineation of the actual transaction between the related parties requires establishing the economically relevant characteristics of the transaction. Such characteristics consist of the conditions of the transaction and the circumstances in which the transaction takes place. They can be broadly categorised as:\n\n(a) The contractual terms of the transaction;\n\n(b) The characteristics of goods sold or purchased, services received or provided, or intangible properties used or transferred;\n\n(c) The functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the parties; and\n\n(d) The commercial and economic circumstances of the parties.\n\nContractual terms of the transaction\n\nA transaction is the consequence of the commercial or financial relations between the related parties.\n\nWhere a transaction has been formalised by the related parties through written contractual agreements, those agreements provide the starting point for delineating the transaction between them, how the transaction is priced and how the responsibilities and risks arising from their interaction are to be divided between them at the time of entering into the agreements.\n\nWritten contractual agreements alone may not provide all the information necessary to perform a transfer pricing analysis, or to provide sufficient information regarding the contractual terms.\n\nFurther information will be required by taking into consideration the analysis of the other economically relevant characteristics mentioned in paragraphs 5.18(b) to (d). Taken together, the analysis provides evidence of the actual conduct of the related parties with regard to the transaction.\n\nWhere conduct is not fully consistent with the contractual terms, further analysis is required to identify the actual transaction.\n\nWhere there are material differences between the contractual terms and the actual conduct of the related parties, the actual transaction should be determined from the actual conduct.\n\nExample:\n\n\u2022 Parent Co in Country P has a distribution agreement with its subsidiary, Sub Co, in Country S.\n\n\u2022 Under the distribution agreement, Sub Co is to distribute Parent Co\u2019s products and to conduct marketing activities in Country S.\n\n\u2022 Based on an analysis of the other economically relevant characteristics mentioned in paragraphs 5.18(b) to (d), it was determined that:\n\no All marketing activities are undertaken by Parent Co, i.e. full responsibility lies with Parent Co.\n\no Sub Co does not have the capability to perform marketing activities.\n\no Sub Co merely distributes the products without performing any marketing activities or incurring any costs relating to such activities.\n\n\u2022 Based on the actual conduct of Parent Co and Sub Co, it can be concluded that the written agreement does not reflect the actual conduct of the parties.\n\n\u2022 Thus, the identification of the actual transaction between Parent Co and Sub Co should not be based solely on the written agreement but should be determined from their actual conduct.\n\nWhere there is no written contractual agreement between the related parties, all aspects of the arrangement would need to be deduced from available evidence of the actual conduct of the parties. This includes the functions that are actually performed, the assets that are actually used or contributed and the risks actually assumed by the parties.\n\nCharacteristics of goods, services or intangible properties\n\nThe specific characteristics of goods, services or intangible properties play a significant part in determining their values in the open market. For instance, a product with better quality and more features would, all other things being equal, fetch a higher selling price. In other words, product or service differentiation affects the price or value of the product or service.\n\nThe nature and features of goods, intangible properties or services transacted between related parties and those between independent parties must be examined carefully. Similarities and differences should be identified as these would influence their value.\n\nImportant characteristics to be examined include:\n\nNature of transaction\n\nPossible comparisons\n\nTransfer of goods\n\n\u2022 Physical features\n\u2022 Quality and reliability\n\u2022 Availability and volume of supply\n\nProvision of services\n\nNature and extent of the services\n\nIntangible properties\n\n\u2022 Form of transaction\n\u2022 Type and nature of the intangible property\n\u2022 Duration and extent of rights provided by the intangible property\n\u2022 Anticipated benefits from the use of the intangible property\n\nIf the comparable uncontrolled price (\u201cCUP\u201d) method is chosen as the most appropriate transfer pricing method (see Step 2 below), ensuring similarities in the actual characteristics of the product, intangible or service would be the most critical when conducting a comparability analysis.\n\nOn the other hand, comparisons of profit margins (as used in transfer pricing methods other than CUP) may be less sensitive to the characteristics of the product or service in question. This is because the margins generally correlate more significantly with the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the taxpayer.\n\nFunctional analysis on Functions performed, Assets used and Risks assumed (\u201cFAR\u201d)\n\nIn transactions between two independent parties, compensation will usually reflect the functions that each enterprise performs, taking into account assets used and risks assumed. The same principle applies to transactions between related parties. Hence, a crucial step in comparability analysis is to conduct a \u201cfunctional analysis\u201d to delineate the related party transaction and determine comparability between the related party transaction and the independent party transactions.\n\nA functional analysis seeks to identify the economically significant activities and responsibilities undertaken, assets used or contributed, and risks assumed by the parties to the transactions.\n\nThe analysis focuses on what the parties actually do and the capabilities they provide. Such activities and capabilities will include decision-making. For example, decisions about business strategy and risks.\n\nThe analysis also considers the type of assets used (such as plant and equipment, valuable intangibles, financial assets, etc.) and the nature of the assets used (such as the age, market value, location, property right protections available, etc.)\n\nIdentifying risks goes hand in hand with identifying functions and assets. Risks are the effect of uncertainty on the objectives of the business. The actual assumption of risks by a taxpayer to a transaction can significantly affect the pricing of that transaction at arm\u2019s length. Thus, when analysing risks, taxpayers should observe:\n\n(a) The effect of the risks assumed may not be apparent in the financial statements. This does not mean that the risks do not exist but it can be that the risks have been effectively managed. Therefore, taxpayer should conduct thorough functional analysis to determine what risks have been assumed, what functions are performed that relate to or affect the assumption or impact of these risks and which party or parties to the transaction assume these risks.\n\n(b) The pricing of the actual transaction should take into account the financial and other consequences of risk assumption and the remuneration for risk management. A taxpayer who assumes a risk is entitled to the upside benefits and incurs the downside costs. A taxpayer who assumes and mitigates the risk will be entitled to a greater remuneration than a taxpayer who only assumes or only mitigates the risk and does not do both.\n\n(c) To assume a risk for transfer pricing purposes, the taxpayer needs to control the risk and has the financial capacity to assume the risk.\n\nExamples:\n\n\u2022 If taxpayer claims that it assumes credit risk when customers default on payments, it would need to demonstrate that it has:\no The financial capacity to assume the risk (such as availability of credit lines from banks),\no The capability and authority to decide to take on, lay off or decline the risk-bearing opportunity, together with the actual performance of that decision-making function, (such as whether or not to sell the product to the customer or whether or not to sell on credit to customer), and\no The capability and authority to decide whether and how to respond to the risk (such as taking legal action to recover the debt).\nTaxpayer may outsource its day-to-day mitigation activities, such as credit risk analysis. However, it has to demonstrate that it has the capability to determine the objective of outsourcing the credit risk analysis, who it wants to hire to perform the credit risk analysis, etc.\n\n\u2022 If taxpayer claims that it assumes inventory obsolescence risk, it would need to demonstrate that it has:\no The financial capacity to assume the risk,\no The capability and authority to decide to take on, lay off or decline the risk (such as whether or not to sell a slow-moving product), and\no The capability and authority to decide whether and how to respond to the risk (such as conducting marketing campaigns to boost ailing sales or employing a diversification strategy).\n\nTheoretically, the level of return derived by a taxpayer should be directly correlated to the FAR. For instance, a taxpayer selling a product with warranty should earn a higher return compared to another taxpayer selling the same product without the warranty. The difference in margin is due to the additional function performed and risk assumed by the first taxpayer. Likewise, a product with a reputable branding is expected to fetch a higher return compared to that of a similar product without the branding. This is due to the additional asset (in this case, trademark) employed in enhancing the value of the product.\n\nThe example below illustrates that arm\u2019s length compensation should reflect the outcome of a functional analysis.\n\nExample:\n\n\u2022 Company A is in the business of distributing general household electrical products in the Asia Pacific (\u201cAPAC\u201d) region. Company A purchases these products from its parent company.\n\n\u2022 Company A conducted a thorough functional analysis which revealed:\n\nFAR\n\nDetails\n\nFunctions Besides distributing the products in the APAC region, Company A undertakes certain functions for the APAC region which include:\n\u2022 Setting and managing all marketing strategies and campaigns\n\u2022 Conducting market intelligence\n\u2022 Analysing consumer demand and the actions of its competitors\n\u2022 Determining volume to be sold\n\u2022 Setting prices for the products to be sold\n\u2022 Conducting credit analysis of customers\n\nAssets\n\nCompany A owns and operates a warehouse to store the products. To ensure orders are processed quickly and to control the inventory level of slow-moving products, Company A utilises a self-inventory management developed automated system to track and process inventories and shipping orders for the APAC region.\n\nRisks\n\nCompany A demonstrated that it assumes credit risk and inventory obsolescence risk as in the examples in paragraph 5.35(c).\n\n\u2022 The arm\u2019s length remuneration for Company A should reflect the distribution function as well as the above functions performed, assets used and risks assumed. The level of remuneration for Company A would be higher compared to another company, Company B, that merely distributes products while the above functions, assets and risks remained with Company B\u2019s parent company.\n\nCommercial and economic circumstances\n\nComparability analysis should take into account the commercial and economic circumstances in which the related and independent parties operate.\n\nPrices may vary across different markets even for transactions involving the same property or services. In order to make meaningful comparisons between related party transactions and independent party transactions with regard to their prices or margins, the markets and economic circumstances in which the parties operate or where the transactions are undertaken should be comparable. Such comparisons include:\n\nCircumstances\n\nEconomic circumstances\n\nPossible comparisons\n\n\u2022 Availability of substitute goods or services\n\u2022 Geographic location\n\u2022 Market size\n\u2022 Extent of competition in the markets\n\u2022 Consumer purchasing power\n\u2022 Level of taxpayers in the market at which they operate (for wholesale or retail)\n\nGovernment policies and regulations\n\n\u2022 Price controls\n\u2022 National insurance\n\nBusiness strategies\n\n\u2022 Innovation development and new product\n\u2022 Degree of diversification\n\u2022 Risk aversion\n\u2022 Assessment of political changes\n\u2022 Duration of arrangements\n\u2022 Other factors bearing upon the daily conduct of business\n\nComparing actual related party transaction with independent party transactions\n\nThe economically relevant characteristics of the actual related party transaction have to be compared with those of independent party transactions in order to determine an arm\u2019s length price for the related party transaction.\n\nWhen making the comparison, these other aspects of comparability analysis are relevant:\n\n(a) Evaluating transactions on a separate or aggregate basis;\n\n(b) Using multiple year data;\n\n(c) Considering losses; and\n\n(d) Selecting comparables.\n\nEvaluating transactions on a separate or aggregate basis\n\nGenerally, the arm\u2019s length principle should be applied on a transaction-by-transaction basis to obtain the most precise approximation of arm\u2019s length conditions.\n\nHowever, where individual transactions are highly inter-related and it can be demonstrated that independent parties in comparable circumstances would typically price the individual transactions on an aggregate basis, taxpayers may consider evaluating the transactions on an aggregate basis.\n\nUsing multiple year data\n\nTo enhance the reliability of the comparability analysis, taxpayers should examine multiple year data as opposed to single year data. Multiple year data helps to identify factors that may have influenced or should have influenced transfer prices, such as long term arrangements and business or product life cycles.\n\nConsidering losses\n\nGenerally, businesses exist with the objective to generate profits. Therefore, a taxpayer transacting with a related party at a loss indicates that the taxpayer may not be compensated at arm\u2019s length.\n\nSimilar to independent parties, a taxpayer transacting with a related party may sustain genuine losses for various reasons such as heavy start-up costs, unfavourable economic conditions, inefficiencies, market penetration business strategy, etc. If so, the claim should be supported with evidence that an independent party would likewise incur losses for a similar period under similar commercial and economic circumstances.\n\nSelecting comparables\n\nA sound comparability analysis requires the selection of reliable comparables. Generally, this is performed prior to or at the time of the related party transactions. These could be either internal or external comparables:\n\nComparables\n\nInternal\n\nCharacteristics\n\nPrice or margin in a comparable transaction between one party which is a party to the related party transaction and an independent party.\n\nExternal\n\nPrice or margin in a comparable transaction between two independent parties, neither of which is a party to the related party transaction.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates internal and external comparables:\n\nComparable circumstances\n\nrelated party transaction\n\nA (taxpayer)\n\nB (related party)\n\nindependent party transaction (internal comparable)\n\nC (independent party)\n\nindependent party transaction (external comparable)\n\nD (independent party)\n\nGenerally, internal comparables may have a more direct and closer relationship to the transaction under review compared to external comparables. Hence, they are preferred because the financial analysis typically would be based on similar accounting standards and information on the comparable transactions would be readily available and more reliable.\n\nInternal comparables may not always be more comparable than external comparables. For example, a taxpayer may sell a significant volume of products to its foreign related party and a much smaller volume to an independent party. The difference in sales volumes is likely to materially affect the comparability of the two transactions. In this case, it may be necessary to search for external comparables that are more comparable.\n\nWhen selecting external comparables, taxpayers should consider the following:\n\n(a) Commercial databases\n\nIRAS does not have a preference for any particular commercial database as long as it provides a reliable source of information that assists taxpayers in performing comparability analysis. Whichever database the taxpayer chooses, transfer pricing documentation should be maintained to demonstrate the results of its comparability analysis.\n\n(b) Comparables with publicly available information\n\nTaxpayers should only use comparables with publicly available information. Such information can be readily obtained from various sources and verified, making the analyses of these comparables more reliable compared to those based on privately held information.\n\nBetween a company that is listed on a stock exchange and one that is not listed, IRAS prefers the former as a comparable because there is generally more information available in the public domain compared to the latter.\n\n(c) Non-local comparables\n\nAs far as possible, taxpayers should use local comparables in their comparability analysis. Generally, these comparables have a higher degree of comparability in terms of their market and economic circumstances compared to non-local comparables. When taxpayers are unable to find sufficiently reliable local comparables, they may expand their search to regional comparables.\n\n(d) Loss-generating comparables\n\nIn conducting their comparability analysis, taxpayers may come across independent parties which have sustained losses over a period of time. If other independent parties have generated profits for a similar period under similar commercial and economic circumstances, the question arises whether the transactions of the loss-making parties are truly reflective of normal business conditions. The persistently loss-making independent parties are therefore likely to be less reliable comparables. Under such circumstances, taxpayers should exclude as comparables independent parties with the following financial results:\n\n\u2022 Weighted average loss for the tested period; or\n\n\u2022 Loss incurred for more than half of the tested period.\n\nWhere there are differences between the economically relevant characteristics of the actual related party transaction and independent party transactions, it is important to consider whether there is comparability between the transactions and what adjustments may be necessary to achieve comparability.\n\nDesired outcome of Step 1\n\nThe aim of the comparability analysis is a comprehensive assessment and identification of significant similarities and differences (such as product characteristics, functions performed, etc.) between the taxpayers or transactions in question and those entities or transactions to be benchmarked against.\n\nWhere reasonably accurate adjustments could be made for material differences identified, the method of making or computing such adjustments should be documented.\n\nA thorough understanding of the level of comparability is necessary in deciding the choice of transfer pricing method and tested party (see Step 2 below).\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Identify the most appropriate transfer pricing method and tested party\n\nThere are five internationally accepted methods for evaluating a taxpayer\u2019s transfer prices or margins against a benchmark based on the prices or margins adopted by independent parties in similar transactions.\n\nThese five methods can be categorised as follows:\n\nTraditional transaction methods Transactional profits methods\n\n\u2022 CUP method\n\u2022 Resale price method\n\u2022 Cost plus method\n\n\u2022 Transactional profit split method\n\u2022 Transactional net margin method (\u201cTNMM\u201d)\n\nTraditional transaction methods compare the price of related party transactions with that of transactions between independent parties. On the other hand, transactional profits methods compare the profit arising from related party transactions with that generated in independent party transactions.\n\nCUP method\n\nThe CUP method compares the following two prices:\n\n(a) The price charged for properties or services transferred in a related party transaction; and\n\n(b) The price charged for properties or services transferred in an independent party transaction in comparable circumstances.\n\nA difference between the two prices above may suggest that the related parties are not dealing at arm\u2019s length. Therefore, the price in the related party transaction may need to be substituted with the price in the independent party transaction.\n\nThe price or value of a property or service is very sensitive to differing characteristics, functions performed and market conditions, etc. Hence, the CUP method is reliable only if:\n\n(a) There is high level of comparability between the related party transaction and the independent party transaction; or\n\n(b) Reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the effects of material differences.\n\nAs the CUP method is the most direct way to determine arm\u2019s length price, it should generally be preferred to the other methods. However, a less direct method is necessary if comparable independent party transactions cannot be found or where reasonably accurate adjustments for differences in comparability cannot be made.\n\nThe CUP method is most suitable to evaluate transactions involving products with very similar characteristics (in terms of type, physical features, quality and quantity transacted, etc.) and undertaken in similar market or economic conditions, such as widely traded commodities. As there should not be much product differentiation for the use of the CUP method, similarities in product characteristics and market or economic conditions are much more significant considerations than the FAR of the taxpayers in determining the suitability of the CUP method.\n\nTaxpayers should rely on internal comparables as far as possible. External comparables may be used if no reliable internal comparable transactions exist. Example 1 and Example 2 in Annex A illustrate the use of an \u201cinternal CUP\u201d and an \u201cexternal CUP\u201d respectively.\n\nResale price method\n\nThe resale price method is applied where a product that has been purchased from a related party is resold to an independent party. Essentially, it values the functions performed by the \u201creseller\u201d of a product.\n\nIn this method, the resale price to the independent party is reduced by a comparable gross margin (the \u201cresale price margin\u201d) to arrive at the arm\u2019s length price of the product transferred between the related parties.\n\nUnder arm\u2019s length conditions, the resale price margin should allow the reseller to recover its selling and operating costs, and earn a reasonable profit based on its FAR.\n\nAs gross profit margins represent the gross compensation (after cost of sales) for specific FAR, product differences are less critical than under the CUP method. Therefore, where the related and independent party transactions are comparable in all aspects except the product, the resale price method may be more reliable than the CUP method. Nonetheless, the more comparable the products, the more likely the resale price method will produce better results.\n\nIf there are material differences that affect the resale price margin earned in the related and independent party transactions, adjustments should be made to eliminate the effects of those differences.\n\nThe resale price method is most appropriate where the reseller adds relatively little value to the properties. The more value the reseller adds to the properties (for example, via complicated processing or assembly with other products), the harder it is to apply the resale price method. This is especially so where the reseller contributes significantly to creating or maintaining intangible properties, such as trademarks or trade names, in its activities.\n\nTaxpayers should rely on internal comparables as far as possible. External comparables may be used if no reliable internal comparable transactions exist. Example 3 in Annex A illustrates the use of the resale price method.\n\nCost plus method\n\nThe cost plus method focuses on the gross mark up obtained by a supplier for property transferred or services provided to a related purchaser. Essentially, it values the functions performed by the supplier of the property or services.\n\nIn this method, a comparable gross mark up is added to the costs of the supplier of goods or services (\u201ccost base\u201d) in the related party transaction to arrive at the arm\u2019s length price of that transaction.\n\nSimilar to the resale price method, fewer adjustments may be necessary to account for product differences compared to the CUP method. It may be appropriate to focus on other factors of comparability, such as the FAR and economic circumstances of the tested party and the comparable entities.\n\nApplying the cost plus method requires the comparability of the gross mark up and cost base in the related and independent party transactions. If the related and independent party transactions are not comparable in all aspects and the differences have a material effect on the price or margin, adjustments should be made to eliminate the effects of those differences.\n\nGenerally, costs can be classified as follows:\n\nType of cost\n\nDirect costs\n\nIndirect costs\n\nExamples\n\n\u2022 Cost of raw materials\n\u2022 Cost of labour\n\n\u2022 Depreciation\n\u2022 Repair and maintenance which may be allocated among several products\n\nOperating expenses\n\n\u2022 Marketing\n\u2022 General and administrative\n\nIn applying the cost plus method, direct and indirect costs of producing a good or providing a service are normally used to compute the cost base. Such costs are limited to the costs of the supplier of goods or services and should take into account an analysis of the supplier\u2019s FAR. The methods of determining the cost base should be consistent over time.\n\nIf the supplier of goods or services is the tested party and is a taxpayer in Singapore, the cost base should be determined according to the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards. Where necessary, adjustments will be made to ensure the cost base is arm\u2019s length. This means that the cost base may include costs not reflected in the tested party\u2019s accounts.\n\nExample:\n\n\u2022 Company A provides services to its related party, Company B.\n\u2022 Company B bore certain cost of $100,000 for the benefit of Company A and related to the services provided by A.\n\u2022 Company B did not allocate the $100,000 to Company A.\n\u2022 Based on an analysis of FAR of Company A and Company B, the $100,000 should be allocated to Company A.\n\u2022 In determining the cost base for the services provided to Company B, the cost base will be adjusted to include the $100,000 even though this amount has not been allocated to Company A and is not reflected in its accounts.\n\nTransactional profit split method (residual analysis approach)\n\nThe transactional profit split method is based on the concept of splitting the combined profits of a transaction between related parties in a similar way as how independent parties would under comparable circumstances.\n\nExample:\n\n\u2022 Company A is a Singapore manufacturing and sales company for telecommunication products. It developed an original microprocessor and holds the patent for the manufacturing technology. Company F, an overseas subsidiary of SingCo, develops and manufactures mobile equipment using the new microprocessor as well as technology developed by itself.\n\n\u2022 Company F is the only manufacturer licensed by SingCo to use the new microprocessor. SingCo purchases all of the mobile equipment manufactured by Company F and sells them to third parties.\n\n\u2022 Both companies contribute to the success of the mobile equipment through their design of the microprocessor and the equipment. As the nature of the products is very advanced and unique, the group is unable to locate any comparable with similar intangible assets. Therefore, neither the traditional methods nor the TNMM is appropriate in this case.\n\n\u2022 Nevertheless, the group is able to obtain reliable data on handphone contract manufacturers and equipment wholesalers without unique intangible property in the telecommunication industry. The manufacturers earn a mark up of 10% while the wholesalers derive a 25% margin on sales.\n\n\u2022 SingCo\u2019s and Company F\u2019s respective share of profit is determined in two stages using the transactional profit split method (residual analysis approach).\n\nStage 1 \u2013 Determining the return for routine contributions\n\nThe simplified accounts of SingCo and Company F are shown below:\n\nCompany F (S$)\n\nSingCo (S$)\n\nSales\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nGross Margin\n\nSales, General & Admin\n\nOperating Margin\n\n100\n\n(60)\n\n40\n\n(5)\n\n35\n\nThe total operating profit for the group is S$45.\n\nCompany F\n\nCost of goods sold\n\nCost mark up of contract manufacturer (10% x S$60)\n\nTransfer price based on comparables (without intangibles)\n\n125\n\n(100)\n\n25\n\n(15)\n\n10\n\nS$60\n\nS$6\n\nS$66\n\nSingCo\n\nSales to third party customers\n\nS$125\n\nResale margin of wholesalers comparables (without intangibles) 25%\n\nS$31.25\n\nResale margin (or gross margin)\n\nComputation of return for routine contributions based on comparables (without intangibles):\n\nCompany F (S$)\n\nSingCo (S$)\n\nSales\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nGross Margin\n\nSales, General & Admin\n\nRoutine operating margin\n\n66\n\n(60)\n\n6\n\n(5)\n\n1\n\nThe total operating margin of the group is S$17.25.\n\n31.25\n\n(15.00)\n\n16.25\n\nStage 2: Dividing the residual profit\n\nThe residual profit of the group = S$45 \u2013 S$17.25 = S$27.75\n\nOn further study of the two companies, two particular expense items, research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) expenses and marketing expenses, are identified as contributing to the key intangibles critical to the success of the mobile equipment. The R&D expenses and marketing expenses incurred by each company are as follows:\n\nSingCo\n\nCompany F\n\nS$12 (80%)\n\nS$3 (20%)\n\nAssuming that the R&D and marketing expenses are equally significant in contributing to the residual profit, based on the proportionate expenses incurred:\n\nSingCo\u2019s share of residual profit (80% x S$27.75)\n\nCompany F\u2019s share of residual profit (20% x S$27.75)\n\nS$22.20\n\nS$5.55\n\nTherefore, the adjusted operating profits of each company are as follows:\n\nSingCo\n\nCompany F\n\n= S$5.55 + S$1\n\n= S$22.20 + S$16.25 = S$38.45\n\nThe adjusted tax accounts are as follows:\n\nSales\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nGross Margin\n\nSales, General & Admin\n\nOperating Margin\n\nCompany F (S$)\n\nSingCo (S$)\n\n71.55\n\n(60.00)\n\n11.55\n\n(5.00)\n\n6.55\n\n125.00\n\n(71.55)\n\n53.45\n\n(15.00)\n\n38.45\n\nHence, the transfer price determined using the transactional profit split method (residual analysis approach) should be S$71.55.\n\nExample 6: Transactional net margin method\n\nSingCo is a Singapore manufacturer of dishwashers. All of SingCo\u2019s dishwashers are sold to an overseas related party, Company G, and bear Company G\u2019s brand. Company G, a household electrical appliances brand name, sells only dishwashers manufactured by SingCo.\n\nThe CUP method is not applied in this case because no reliable adjustments can be made to account for differences with similar products in the market.\n\nAfter the appropriate functional analysis, SingCo was able to identify a Singapore manufacturer of home electrical appliances, Company H, as a suitable comparable company. However, Company H performs warranty functions for its independent wholesalers, whereas SingCo does not. Company H realizes a net mark up or operating margin of 10%.\n\nAs the costs pertaining to the warranty functions cannot be separately identified in Company H\u2019s accounts and no reliable adjustments can be made to account for the difference in the functions, it may be more reliable to examine the net margins in this case. The transfer price for SingCo\u2019s sale of dishwashers to Company G is computed using the TNMM as follows:\n\nSingCo\u2019s cost of goods sold\n\nSingCo\u2019s operating expenses\n\nTotal costs\n\nAdd: Net mark up (10% x S$6,500)\n\nTransfer price based on TNMM\n\nS$5,000\n\nS$1,500\n\nS$6,500\n\nS$650\n\nS$7,150\n\nANNEX B \u2013 Samples and guides for MAP and APA process\n\nAnnex B1: Sample of letter of authorisation\n\nNote: The letter is to be printed on the taxpayer\u2019s letterhead\n\n[Date]\n\nInternational Tax and Relations Division\nTransfer Pricing and Dispute Resolution Branch\nInland Revenue Authority of Singapore\n55 Newton Road\nSingapore 307987\n\nAttention: [IRAS Case Officer]\n\nLETTER OF AUTHORITY- APPLICATION FOR *[MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE (\u201cMAP\u201d)/ BILATERAL ADVANCE PRICING ARRANGEMENT (\u201cBAPA\u201d)/ UNILATERAL ADVANCE PRICING ARRANGEMENT (\u201cUAPA\u201d)] BY [NAME(S) OF TAXPAYER(S)]\n\nDear Sir/ Madam,\n\nThis is to advise that we have appointed [Tax agent/ representative (Name and contact information)] to represent us on all matters relating to the above application.

Application of the arm's length principle in transactions with related parties.\n2. Specific transactions, including related party services and loans.\n3. Maintenance of transfer pricing documentation.\n4. Utilization of double taxation agreements (DTA) to resolve transfer pricing disputes.\n5. Understanding the implications of non-compliance with transfer pricing requirements.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **Transfer Pricing:** Refers to the pricing of transactions between related parties, which may differ from market prices due to the lack of independence in their relationships.\n- **Arm's Length Principle:** Transactions between related parties should be priced as if they were between independent parties, ensuring that profits are taxed where economic activities occur.\n- **Double Taxation:** Occurs when two tax authorities claim the same income for taxation. Taxpayers can seek relief through mutual agreement procedures under DTAs.\n\n**Transfer Pricing Methods:**\n1. **Traditional Transaction Methods:**\n   - **Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) Method:** Compares prices of related party transactions with those of independent parties.\n   - **Resale Price Method:** Determines the arm's length price by deducting an appropriate gross margin from the resale price to an independent party.\n   - **Cost Plus Method:** Adds a comparable gross markup to the costs incurred by the supplier in a related party transaction.\n\n2. **Transactional Profits Methods:**\n   - **Transactional Profit Split Method:** Splits combined profits from a transaction between related parties based on their contributions.\n   - **Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM):** Compares the net profit margin of a taxpayer from a related party transaction to that of comparable independent parties.\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\nTaxpayers must maintain proper documentation to demonstrate compliance with the arm's length principle, including:\n- Functional analysis of the parties involved.\n- Comparability analysis to identify similar independent transactions.\n- Details of the transfer pricing methods applied.\n\n**Compliance and Adjustments:**\n- IRAS may adjust taxable profits if related party transactions do not adhere to the arm's length principle, potentially leading to double taxation.\n- Taxpayers are encouraged to engage with IRAS for guidance and to resolve any issues regarding compliance.\n\n**Glossary of Key Terms:**\n- **Advance Pricing Arrangement (APA):** An agreement between IRAS and taxpayers on the transfer pricing method to be used for specific transactions.\n- **Competent Authority:** The designated authority (IRAS) responsible for resolving transfer pricing disputes.\n- **Functional Analysis:** Identifies the functions performed, assets used, and risks assumed by each party in a transaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe e-Tax guide emphasizes the importance of adhering to the arm's length principle in transfer pricing to ensure fair taxation and reduce the risk of double taxation. Taxpayers are encouraged to maintain comprehensive documentation and engage with IRAS for compliance.",

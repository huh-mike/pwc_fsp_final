        "text": "Record Keeping Guide for Non-GST Registered Businesses\n\nThis e-Tax Guide provides the mandatory record keeping requirements for businesses not registered for Goods and Services Tax (GST) in order to comply with Singapore Tax laws.\n\nThis guide is designed to help non-GST registered businesses prepare and keep records for Income Tax purposes. IRAS recognizes that small businesses have simpler business and tax affairs, and has introduced simplified record keeping requirements for small businesses from 1 January 2014. Qualifying businesses can choose to adhere to the record keeping requirements set out in the e-Tax Guide, \u201cSimplified Record Keeping Requirements for Small Businesses.\u201d\n\nWhat types of records do businesses need to keep? The types of records businesses need to keep include:\n\na) Source documents that substantiate all business transactions including receipts, invoices, vouchers, other relevant documents issued to or received from customers/suppliers, bank statements;\n\nb) Accounting ledgers, schedules and journals documenting a business\u2019 assets and liabilities, income and expenses, profits and losses; and\n\nc) Any other written evidence of transactions connected with your business.\n\nThe above applies regardless of the payment mode or platform through which the business transactions were processed such as cashless e-payment services (e.g. PayNow), Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) platforms, e-commerce marketplaces and delivery platforms etc.\n\nGood record keeping practices are an important part of doing business. Having good record keeping practices can benefit you in the following ways:\n\na) Make better business decisions;\n\nb) Be aware of the financial status of your business (e.g. profit or loss position, and/or internal fraud or theft (if any); and\n\nc) Reduce the cost and effort required to file Income Tax returns, and to reply to IRAS\u2019 queries (if any).\n\nIt is the responsibility of business owners and company directors to ensure that proper records are kept. You are expected to put in place a record keeping system to ensure that your Income Tax declarations are duly supported with the required documents.\n\nYou can maintain records of your business transactions in physical form. Examples of physical/paper-based records are record books, receipts and physical invoices. Business transactions must be supported by source documents such as invoices/receipts from your suppliers, and duplicate copies of invoices/receipts issued to your customers. You must ensure that all physical records are kept in a legible and well-organized manner. For example, you should retain photocopies of receipts printed on thermal paper in case the originals fade over time.\n\nYou can also keep records electronically using a computer and/or accounting software. This includes using Microsoft Office applications, off-the-shelf accounting software, customized accounting software and image systems. Physical copies of source documents need not be kept to substantiate your business transactions for tax purposes if the source documents are kept electronically. You do not need to seek approval from IRAS to keep your records in an electronic format for tax purposes. However, you should ensure that proper internal controls are put in place to ensure the integrity, completeness, accuracy, availability and reliability of the electronic records, including all transactions executed electronically, where applicable.\n\nAdvantages of keeping records electronically include:\n\ni. Quick, efficient and accurate recording of your business transactions (including details such as customer particulars, payment details, and stock/inventory details);\n\nii. Getting timely updates on how your business is performing so that you can plan ahead and forecast your business needs;\n\niii. Convenient keeping of invoices and ease of generating summaries and reports to fulfill your tax and other business reporting obligations;\n\niv. Less storage space required as compared to physical records;\n\nv. Facilitating the backing up of records and allowing backup records to be kept in a safer place in the event of theft or natural disasters. Backing up your records will benefit your business. In the event that your business records are missing or destroyed, it is your responsibility to make use of other relevant documents to reproduce your records.\n\nAccounting software is a helpful tool that may assist you to improve your record keeping practices and tax compliance. You may refer to the Accounting Software Register Plus (ASR+) for a list of accounting software that are integrated with key IRAS-API digital products and recommended digital products/features to streamline tax compliance procedures.\n\nA manual record keeping system may be sufficient if your business has small volumes of transactions. However, as your business expands and the number of transactions increases, a manual record keeping system may no longer be able to meet your needs. For instance, if you are a retailer with many outlets, an electronic record keeping system may be more useful in managing your business records. Using an electronic record keeping system will incur lower manpower costs as you would not have to manually track each and every business transaction. For source documents (e.g. receipts, invoices, vouchers), you can keep them either in physical or electronic form.\n\nYour business records must be kept up-to-date, and in such a manner that would enable IRAS to verify the figures you state in your Income Tax returns. In the absence of records, IRAS will refer to available sources to estimate your business performance. Expense claims and other claims (e.g. for capital allowance) may be disallowed in the event of insufficient records.\n\nUnder the Income Tax Act 1947, you are required to keep your records for five years. In addition to the above requirement, for tax purposes, companies and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) are also required to retain records of the company and/or LLP for a period of 5 years after the date on which the company and/or LLP is struck off/dissolved/wound up. The responsibility of maintaining the records upon cessation of the business operations will rest with the person who was an officer of the company/LLP immediately before the company/LLP was dissolved. In the case of a liquidation, the responsibility of maintaining the records will rest with the liquidator of the company/LLP.\n\nOther than the record keeping requirements for Income Tax purposes, you may also be required to maintain your records to meet the statutory requirements under other relevant legislation (e.g. Companies\u2019 Act 1967).\n\nIt is important to follow the requirements set out in this e-Tax Guide. Failure to comply may constitute an offence under Section 67 of the Income Tax Act 1947 (read with Section 94 of the Income Tax Act 1947), which could result in:\n\na) IRAS exercising its best judgement to estimate revenue earned;\n\nb) Expense claims and capital allowances being disallowed; and/or\n\nc) Penalties being imposed.\n\nUnder the Income Tax Act 1947, a maximum fine of $5,000 may be imposed (in default of payment, a jail term of up to six months may be imposed).\n\nBusinesses must retain records (including source documents) for, and be able to explain ALL transactions relating to the business income. The records required include:\n\na) Serially-numbered receipts/vouchers issued or cash register tapes as proof of all sales transactions;\n\nb) Rental agreements signed with tenants as proof of rental income;\n\nc) Books where stock/inventory taken for private consumption is recorded;\n\nd) Credit notes issued, e.g. for goods returned, services not supplied;\n\ne) Export documents, e.g. delivery orders, bills of lading, air waybills, export permits;\n\nf) Evidence of payments received (e.g. bank statements); and\n\ng) Contracts/agreements signed with customers.\n\nIf the proceeds received from your sales are used to pay for your business expenses or purchases, you must record the proceeds used and include them as sales. Similarly, if you make any personal drawings from your business\u2019 cash collection, you must record the drawings and include them as sales. Please note that sales are to be reported in your Income Tax returns as \u201crevenue\u201d.\n\nBusinesses must retain records (including source documents) for and be able to explain ALL transactions relating to business expenses. The records required include:\n\na) Sales invoices, tax invoices, simplified tax invoices or receipts received as proof of business expenses;\n\nb) Payment vouchers for payments made for services received and the relevant contracts/agreements signed with the service providers;\n\nc) Payment vouchers for staff remuneration;\n\nd) Evidence of CPF contributions made as an employer;\n\ne) Rental agreements signed with landlords as proof of rental expenses;\n\nf) Evidence of payments made (e.g. bank statements); and\n\ng) Minutes of Annual General Meeting (AGM)/Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) reflecting the approval of directors\u2019 fees.\n\nBusinesses must retain records (including source documents) for and be able to explain ALL transactions relating to business purchases. The records required include:\n\na) Sales invoices/tax invoices/simplified tax invoices, receipts or credit notes received from suppliers, and debit notes issued to suppliers as proof of business purchases;\n\nb) Import documents e.g. bills of lading, air waybills, import permits, subsidiary import certificates, inward summary reports from Air Express Companies (AEC);\n\nc) Evidence of payments made (e.g. bank statements); and\n\nd) Contracts/agreements signed with suppliers.\n\nRecord business purchases on a daily basis.\n\nBusinesses must keep accounting records and schedules which summarize their business transactions in a systematic order. These include:\n\na) Stock/inventory lists as proof of stock/inventory on hand at the end of each accounting period;\n\nb) Sales listings as proof of income transactions;\n\nc) Purchase listings as proof of purchase transactions;\n\nd) General ledgers to record assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses;\n\ne) Detailed schedules of public transport expenses, overseas travelling expenses and entertainment expenses; and\n\nf) Fixed asset schedules.\n\nAccounting records and schedules for a financial year can be used to prepare a business\u2019 Profit and Loss Statement and Balance Sheet. IRAS has also published record keeping guidelines and templates for businesses (sole-proprietors/self-employed) in specific industries to provide additional guidance on record keeping.\n\nBusinesses must keep the source documents (e.g. receipts, tax invoices, vouchers, other relevant documents) used to prepare these accounting records and schedules as IRAS may request for an explanation on how the records/schedules were arrived at. Failure to keep source documents may result in IRAS exercising its best judgement to estimate revenue earned, disallowing claims for expenses and capital allowances, and imposing penalties.\n\nUpon request by IRAS, you should be able to produce your records in the file formats specified below:\n\nFile Format Options (for data listings)\n\ni. Microsoft Excel spreadsheet; or\n\nii. Microsoft Access file; or\n\niii. Delimited text files (e.g. comma-separated values file, \u201c.csv\u201d);\n\nFile Format Options (for non-data listings)\n\ni. Microsoft Word document; or\n\nii. Adobe Acrobat document.\n\nIf you issue a sales invoice, it should include the following information:\n\na) An identifying number (e.g. invoice number);\n\nb) Date of issue of the invoice;\n\nc) Your business name, address and business registration number;\n\nd) Your customer\u2019s name and address;\n\ne) A description sufficient to identify the goods or services supplied and type of supply;\n\nf) For each description of goods or services supplied, the quantity of goods or the extent of services, and the price;\n\ng) Any cash discount offered; and\n\nh) The total price.\n\nYou may design and print your own invoices or buy pre-printed invoices. If you wish to issue electronic sales invoices, you are required to comply with the following:\n\na) Establish internal controls to ensure that electronic sales invoices issued and transmitted to customers are complete and accurate;\n\nb) Establish internal controls to ensure that electronic sales invoices cannot be manipulated before and during transmission;\n\nc) Do not issue sales invoices in paper form to customers that you have already issued electronic sales invoices; and\n\nd) Ensure that the electronic tax invoices are stored and made available in human readable format for verification and record keeping purposes.\n\nIf your customer pays in cash, you must show clearly in the sales invoice that payment has been received and the date of receipt of the payment.\n\nYou may choose to issue a receipt to your customers. However, you should issue receipts upon customers\u2019 requests. Receipts serve as proof of your income transactions and must be serially numbered, with duplicate copies to be retained. You are not required to seek approval from IRAS if you choose not to issue receipts for tax purposes. You must however ensure complete and accurate recording of all income transactions. There must be a well-documented audit trail to show that all income transactions are correctly recorded and declared for tax purposes. Practices such as using a cash register or accounting software should be maintained to help ensure the proper recording of all income transactions.\n\nWhen making purchases for business purposes, you should ask for a receipt regardless of the payment mode and amount. Receipts serve as proof of payments made. The details that should be shown in a receipt include:\n\na) Date of issue of the receipt;\n\nb) Your business name and business registration number; and\n\nc) The total amount payable.\n\nA receipt from a cash register would suffice, provided that it contains a description of the goods or services supplied.\n\nYou must retain records (including source documents) for and be able to explain ALL transactions relating to your business expenses, including disposal of business goods, regardless of whether consideration was received (e.g. trading stock given away free to employees/customers).\n\nA cash register with an internal tape can be used to record all cash sales. When using a cash register, you must ensure that all cash sales are recorded in the cash register and the internal tape is retained. As a good practice, you should record the total amount of cash receipts manually or electronically at the end of each day.\n\nIf you remove goods from your stock/inventory for your private consumption, the market value of the goods should be added to your sales.\n\nCredit notes may be issued for goods which have been sold but subsequently returned, for credits/discounts given for a past sale transaction, or to correct a mistake. Transactions such as return of goods due to e.g. incorrect quantity, defective or damaged goods, or incorrect invoicing; or partial/full waiver of charges before the delivery of goods need to be recorded because they reduce the sales figures.\n\nA credit note must include the following details:\n\na) An identifying number (e.g. a serial number);\n\nb) Date of issue;\n\nc) Your business name and address;\n\nd) Your customer's name and address;\n\ne) The identifying number and date of issue of the original invoice;\n\nf) A description sufficient to identify the goods or services for which the credit is given;\n\ng) Reason for the credit given e.g. \"returned goods\";\n\nh) Quantity and amount credited for each item; and\n\ni) Total amount credited.\n\nIf you import and export goods in the course of your business, you are required to keep records where applicable, such as:\n\na) Import and export permits;\n\nb) Subsidiary import/export certificates;\n\nc) Notes of shipment;\n\nd) Parcel despatch notes;\n\ne) Courier consignment notes;\n\nf) Inward summary reports from AEC;\n\ng) Bills of lading/air waybills;\n\nh) IESGP (customs) permits;\n\ni) Invoices/purchase orders;\n\nj) Packing lists;\n\nk) Delivery notes;\n\nl) Insurance documents; and\n\nm) Evidence of payments.\n\nBank statements are vital to your business\u2019 record keeping. Businesses must retain all business-related bank statements. In addition, there should be separate bank accounts for personal and business purposes. In the absence of separate bank accounts, personal and business transactions should be differentiable.\n\nRegular depositing of all business receipts into the business bank account enables easier tracking of business income. All purchases and expenses should be paid by digital modes (e.g. interbank transfers) so that they would be reflected in the bank statements.\n\nBank statement details may differ from your records as direct debits, bank charges and interest may be deducted from your bank account. You will not know the amount of these deductions until you receive the bank statements. You are advised to do regular bank reconciliation to update your records with the deductions stated in your bank statements.\n\nStaff remuneration includes wages, salaries, bonuses, commission income and allowances. You need to keep the following records:\n\na) Details of employees, including full name, identification number and designation;\n\nb) Payment vouchers or remuneration schedules; and\n\nc) CPF statements for your claims of employer\u2019s CPF contributions.\n\nIf you issue payment vouchers instead of paying cash to individuals for services rendered (e.g. cleaning services, freelance bookkeeping), you are required to include the following details in the payment vouchers:\n\na) Full name, identification number and address of the recipient;\n\nb) Date of payment and nature of services rendered;\n\nc) Basis of arriving at the quantum paid; and\n\nd) Acknowledgement of receipt by the recipient.\n\nPreparing a stock/inventory list will help you keep track of the stock/inventory on hand at the end of each accounting period. Stock/inventory includes anything produced, manufactured, acquired or purchased for the purpose of manufacture or sale. To determine the closing stock/inventory value, a physical stock count should be carried out at the end of each accounting period.\n\nExpenses incurred for business purposes qualify for tax deduction subject to the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 1947. You should keep the following expense schedules for claiming of tax deductions:\n\na) Public Transport Expenses, with the following details recorded for each travel:\n\ni. Date and destination;\n\nii. Mode of transport;\n\niii. Name and designation of person incurring it;\n\niv. Purpose of travel; and\n\nv. Amount incurred.\n\nb) Overseas Travelling Expenses, with the following details recorded for each travel:\n\ni. Date and destination;\n\nii. Mode of transport;\n\niii. Name and designation of person incurring it;\n\niv. Purpose and duration of overseas travel; and\n\nv. Amount incurred.\n\nc) Entertainment Expenses, with the following details recorded for each activity:\n\ni. Date and place of entertainment;\n\nii. Name and designation of person incurring it;\n\niii. Purpose of entertainment;\n\niv. Name and designation of person(s) entertained; and\n\nv. Amount incurred.\n\nYou should keep source documents such as taxi receipts and travel documents to substantiate your public transport expense, overseas travelling expense, and entertainment expense claims. Credit card slips or monthly credit card statements alone are not sufficient to substantiate your claims.\n\nA fixed asset schedule should detail all the expenditure relating to your business\u2019 fixed assets (such as plant and equipment, and motor vehicles). You are advised to prepare a fixed asset schedule at the time you start your business to record the assets purchased. The following details should be recorded for each asset purchased:\n\na) Date of purchase and cost; and\n\nb) Date of sale and sale price (if applicable).\n\nDocuments such as contracts of purchase or sale (e.g. hire purchase agreements), and invoices should be kept. The amounts incurred in the purchase of fixed assets are capital in nature and are not deductible for tax purposes. However, you can claim capital allowances. You should record capital allowances that you have already claimed as tax deductions so that you can calculate your entitlement to capital allowances in subsequent years.\n\nYou should keep records once you start business operations. These are some tips for record keeping:\n\na) Set up a record keeping system which can be understood by any person familiar with the business operations and not only the accounts personnel. The system should also alert you when it is time to follow up on debt owed to your business or to take action when payments are due. This will enable you to better manage your cash flow as well as reconcile your business transactions;\n\nb) Record transactions daily to keep records up-to-date;\n\nc) Obtain the necessary source document(s) at the time of a transaction. Do not delay until you need these source documents to support your expense claims;\n\nd) Cross reference your records e.g., indicate payment reference number in the invoice;\n\ne) Check that all transactions are entered accurately; and\n\nf) Set up a bank account for the business to allow clearer management of business funds.\n\nFor more information on record keeping, please visit the IRAS website at www.iras.gov.sg.

The words 'Tax Invoice' prominently displayed. 2. The invoice date. 3. A unique invoice number. 4. The name, address, and GST registration number of the supplier. 5. The name and address of the recipient. 6. A description of the goods or services supplied. 7. The total amount payable, excluding GST. 8. The GST amount charged. 9. The total amount payable, including GST. For more information on GST invoicing requirements, please refer to the official IRAS website. GST-registered businesses will be required to transmit invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions via the InvoiceNow network. This mandatory participation will be implemented progressively: From 1 November 2025, for newly incorporated companies that register for GST voluntarily, and from 1 April 2026, for all new voluntary GST-registrants. A soft launch for early adoption will commence from 1 May 2025. IRAS encourages all GST-registered businesses and businesses applying for GST registration on/after 1 May 2025 to transmit their invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions via the InvoiceNow network. There are plans to progressively extend mandatory participation to new compulsory GST registrants and existing GST-registered businesses. We will continue to consult industry partners and carefully review the feedback received before announcing further details. Using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions offers advantages such as simplicity, efficiency, and reliability. Businesses can benefit from reduced compliance efforts when preparing data for submission to IRAS, and with IRAS\u2019 enhanced risk detection capabilities, fewer businesses would potentially be selected for GST audits. The invoice data must be transmitted to IRAS by the earlier of the date on which the relevant GST return is filed or the filing due date of the relevant GST return. Businesses are required to transmit to IRAS data on standard-rated supplies, zero-rated supplies, exempt supplies, standard-rated purchases, and zero-rated purchases. Notably, transactions where there are no underlying supplies or purchases are excluded from the scope of data collection. The adoption of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement does not preclude businesses from having to comply with the mandatory record-keeping requirements for GST-registered businesses. Businesses using IMDA-accredited InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Providers may be eligible to apply for the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) and receive up to $30,000 for IT solutions and equipment, including InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions. We are also working closely with the IRSPs to provide Free-of-Charge solution packages for businesses to adopt. These packages aim to reduce the costs associated with complying with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement and the expenses related to integrating their existing system infrastructure with InvoiceNow.\", 'urls': ['https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/nationwide-e-invoicing-framework/invoicenow', 'https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/nationwide-e-invoicing-framework/invoicenow-ready-solution-provider', 'https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/financial-support/productivity-solutions-grant', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/gst/etaxguide_gst_invoicenow_requirement.pdf?sfvrsn=d2828aad_25', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/gst/frequently-asked-questions-for-gst-invoicenow-requirement.pdf?sfvrsn=fb2849aa_5']}",

Existing GST-registered businesses will also be progressively required to comply.\n\nThe transmission of invoice data must occur by the earlier of the GST return filing date or its due date, covering standard-rated and zero-rated supplies and purchases, while excluding transactions without underlying supplies. Compliance with record-keeping requirements remains mandatory.\n\nBusinesses using accredited InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Providers may qualify for the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG), offering up to $30,000 for IT solutions. Additionally, free solution packages will be available to help businesses integrate with InvoiceNow and reduce compliance costs.

The Guide also provides details to support GST-registered businesses to adopt the requirement.\n\nYou should read this Guide if:\n\n(a) you are required to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement as an additional condition to be voluntarily registered for GST; or\n\n(b) you do not fall within the GST InvoiceNow Requirement but would like to take up an InvoiceNow-Ready Solution to transmit invoice data to IRAS via the InvoiceNow network as an early adopter.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to be a technical specification for the GST InvoiceNow Requirement or for InvoiceNow. For system architects, software developers and IT support personnel of Access Points Providers, Solution Providers and businesses using their own in-house enterprise solutions, the relevant technical documents are available at APEX portal and IMDA\u2019s InvoiceNow Technical Playbook. These documents provide details on the solutioning and cover the system implementation know-how.\n\nAt a Glance\n\nWith the announcement of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement, GST-registered businesses will be required to use InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to send invoice data directly to IRAS for tax administration. This will be done in phases, starting with the new voluntary GST registrants. The transmission of invoice data to IRAS will be done seamlessly through IMDA-accredited Access Point Providers via Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) technology.\n\nThis move is in line with international trends, with governments worldwide actively promoting the adoption of e-invoicing for tax administration. The phased adoption of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement follows a pilot by IRAS, IMDA, businesses and service providers between Sep 2020 and Jun 2023.\n\nTo allow businesses sufficient lead time to prepare, the GST InvoiceNow Requirement will be implemented in a calibrated and progressive manner as follows:\n\n(a) From 1 Nov 2025, for newly incorporated companies (incorporated within 6 months from the time they submit the application for GST registration) that apply for voluntary GST registration.\n\n(b) From 1 Apr 2026, for all new voluntary GST registrants, regardless of incorporation date or business constitution.\n\nA soft launch will commence from 1 May 2025, allowing non-mandatory participation from any existing GST-registered businesses and those applying for GST registration on/after 1 May 2025 that wish to be early adopters to transmit invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nAdopting InvoiceNow will help businesses better fulfil their responsibilities as GST-registered businesses, by facilitating record-keeping, billing, and payment processes. In particular, it supports new GST-registered businesses to get their compliance right from the start.\n\nThere are plans to progressively extend mandatory participation to new compulsory GST registrants and remaining GST-registered businesses. We will continue to consult industry partners and carefully review the feedback received before announcing further details.\n\nGlossary\n\nInvoiceNow refers to Singapore\u2019s nationwide e-invoicing network that is based on the international standard called \u201cPeppol\u201d. It connects all businesses and facilitates the transmission of invoices within the InvoiceNow network in a standardised manner.\n\nThe GST InvoiceNow Requirement is a joint initiative between IRAS and IMDA to digitalise invoicing and facilitate the submission of invoice data by GST-registered businesses to IRAS by leveraging the InvoiceNow network. GST-registered businesses that are required to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement will be required to use InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to send invoice data to IRAS for tax administration.\n\nThe data to be transmitted covers all data on invoices or equivalent documents that serve as bills for payment (or adjustments of bill for payment) for supplies and purchases made. Below are some examples of such documents:\n\nDocuments that serve as bill for payment (considered as invoice data)\n\n\u2022 Sales invoice\n\u2022 Tax invoice\n\u2022 Simplified tax invoice\n\u2022 Serially numbered receipts\n\u2022 Debit notes\n\u2022 Credit notes\n\nThe above documents are collectively referred to as \u201cinvoice\u201d, and their data are referred to as \u201cinvoice data\u201d in this e-Tax Guide.\n\nIn situations where a supply or purchase does not entail the issuance of an invoice, businesses should still transmit the data that they record into their accounting system. This could happen, for example, when related entities make supplies to each other but opt to settle by offsetting their accounts receivable/payable in lieu of issuing invoices and making payment.\n\nInvoiceNow-Ready Solutions are accounting and finance software that facilitate the transmission of invoices between businesses via the InvoiceNow network. They can be purchased off-the-shelf or be customised specifically for businesses in the form of proprietary enterprise resource planning systems.\n\nInvoiceNow-Ready Solutions connected to IRAS through IMDA-accredited Access Points will enable the transmission of invoice data to IRAS via API technology. IMDA will publish the list of IMDA-accredited InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions that are connected to IRAS by May 2025.\n\nIRSPs are providers offering accounting or finance solutions which are connected to the InvoiceNow network via IMDA-accredited Access Points.\n\nAPs create and maintain the connectivity gateways i.e. Access Points that function as access nodes on the InvoiceNow network; they also ensure compliance to the Peppol standards and routing of invoices to the correct destination Access Points.\n\nThe differences between an IRSP and an AP are summarised below:\n\nRole\n\nIRSP\n\nAP\n\nWhat services do they provide?\n\n\u2022 Build the software features to support the GST InvoiceNow Requirement and connectivity to the Access Points\n\n\u2022 Connect IRSPs and businesses with in-house enterprise solutions to the InvoiceNow network\n\n\u2022 Businesses will have to rely on separate accounting or finance solutions to perform accounting and finance functions\n\n\u2022 IRSPs provide solutions with different capabilities, ranging from simple and free-of-charge invoicing functions to a full suite of accounting and finance functions\n\nA Peppol invoice refers to an invoice created and transmitted from the supplier to the customer through the InvoiceNow network. Both the supplier and the customer must be on the InvoiceNow network before the supplier can issue a Peppol invoice to the customer.\n\nIn the Peppol submission method, a copy of the Peppol invoice data is automatically transmitted to IRAS when the Peppol invoice is routed from the supplier to the customer through the InvoiceNow network.\n\nA solution-extracted invoice refers to:\n\n(a) A non-Peppol invoice issued outside the InvoiceNow network for supplies and recorded into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. Non-Peppol invoices include paper/PDF invoices issued to individuals or customers who are not on the network.\n\n(b) A purchase invoice that is recorded into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nIn the solution-extracted submission method, a copy of the solution-extracted invoice data is automatically extracted from the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution and transmitted to IRAS regularly (e.g. daily or weekly).\n\nThe Peppol ID is the unique address that enables companies, organizations, and authorities to receive business messages, such as e-invoices and e-orders, via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nThe SG Peppol Directory is a facility for searching Singapore businesses that are registered on the InvoiceNow network. The SG Peppol Directory allows businesses to search for other companies registered on the InvoiceNow network to send and receive e-invoices electronically through the nationwide e-invoicing network.\n\nIRSPs and APs will need to assist businesses to register for Peppol ID and update the businesses\u2019 details in the Service Metadata Publisher (\u201cSMP\u201d), so that businesses can be listed on the SG Peppol Directory.\n\nInvoiceNow\n\nLaunched in 2019, InvoiceNow is a nationwide e-invoicing network that is based on the Peppol standard. Managed by Infocomm Media Development Authority (\u201cIMDA\u201d), which is appointed as Singapore\u2019s Peppol Authority, InvoiceNow aims to connect all active businesses and encourage digitalisation through the direct transmission of invoices in standard digital format between suppliers and customers, from one finance system to another.\n\nWithin the InvoiceNow network, invoices are exchanged using a common Extensible Markup Language (or \u201cXML\u201d) format known as the Business Interoperability Specification Billing 3.0 Universal Business Language (or \u201cBIS Billing 3.0 UBL\u201d). This common standard allows users to adopt their preferred solutions, while being able to exchange invoices with their partners who may not be using the same solution but are on InvoiceNow. An upgrade to the Singapore BIS Bill 3.0 UBL Specification (\u201cSG Peppol BIS 3.0\u201d) called the Singapore Peppol International (\u201cPINT-SG\u201d) Specification was launched in Feb 2024. This upgraded specification enables users to experience seamless cross-border transactions. PINT-SG is also the base data format used to support the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nThe process of sending and receiving invoices in PDF format via email is not considered e-invoicing. Even though both supplier and customer issue and receive the invoice digitally in both scenarios, the customer who receives an invoice in PDF format would still need to record the details of the invoice into its own accounting system. On the other hand, the details of the invoice issued via InvoiceNow will be transmitted directly into the customer\u2019s accounting system without human intervention. This speeds up invoice processing, which results in faster digital payment, and greatly reduces the time spent verifying invoices and receiving payment.\n\nThe illustration below gives an overview of the 4-corner model under InvoiceNow. In any given business transaction, the supplier can send its invoice directly to the InvoiceNow-Ready accounting or finance solution of the customer, using the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution of the supplier\u2019s choice. The supplier will utilise the necessary information in the SG Peppol Directory to identify the customer and create the invoice. The created invoice will be sent by the supplier (\u201cCorner 1\u201d) to the supplier\u2019s Access Point (\u201cCorner 2\u201d) to facilitate the transmission of the invoice to the customer\u2019s Access Point (\u201cCorner 3\u201d), before it is transmitted to the customer (\u201cCorner 4\u201d). Businesses on the network can use an InvoiceNow-Ready accounting or finance solution of their choice. Once connected to InvoiceNow, the business will effectively be connected to all other businesses that are on the InvoiceNow network.\n\nBenefits of using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions\n\nThe adoption of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions offers the following advantages as compared to the traditional paper or PDF-based invoicing:\n\n(a) Streamlined processes: InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions enable direct transmission of e-invoices in a structured data format across different finance systems, thereby eliminating manual work involved in sending, receipting and recording of invoices into systems.\n\n(b) Reduced errors and costs: InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions reduce manual processes, along with errors and rectification costs. With invoice records maintained electronically, such solutions also reduce invoice storage and retrieval costs.\n\n(c) Improved cashflow management: InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions facilitate quicker invoice processing and payment, helping businesses to more effectively manage their cashflow.\n\nFor more information about InvoiceNow, please refer to the InvoiceNow FAQs or visit IMDA\u2019s website www.imda.gov.sg/invoicenow.\n\nGST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nTo support the nationwide InvoiceNow initiative, and as part of our ongoing transformation efforts to digitalise with the wider ecosystem and integrate tax into taxpayers\u2019 accounting and payroll systems, GST-registered businesses will be required to use InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to send invoice data to IRAS for tax administration.\n\nHow GST InvoiceNow Requirement works\n\nUnder the requirement, GST-registered businesses will need to submit invoice data pertaining to their GST supplies and purchases to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions and via the InvoiceNow network. Invoices that are not issued using InvoiceNow (e.g. for supplies made to businesses not on the InvoiceNow network or supplies made via point-of-sale systems) should also be sent to IRAS when they are recorded in the accounting system. More details on the scope of transactions can be found in the \u201cScope of Invoice Data to Transmit\u201d section below.\n\nIRAS is connected to the InvoiceNow network, via the Access Point, to receive copies of the invoice data transmitted through the InvoiceNow network, whenever businesses transact. This is achieved through the introduction of a 5th corner to the 4-corner model under InvoiceNow.\n\nThe transmission of invoice data to IRAS will be performed via API technology. When businesses activate the GST InvoiceNow Submission feature in their InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to transmit invoice data to IRAS, IRAS will receive a copy of the invoice data whenever businesses issue or receive invoices via the InvoiceNow network, or record invoices into their InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions.\n\nAdditional benefits for adopting InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to transmit invoice data to IRAS\n\nBesides enjoying the benefits of InvoiceNow, GST-registered businesses that transmit invoice data to IRAS can also benefit from reduced compliance efforts when preparing data for submission to IRAS.\n\nWith IRAS\u2019 better risk analysis capabilities, fewer businesses would potentially be selected for GST audits. Those selected for audits may also expect shorter audits and faster resolution of the audit issues. Businesses claiming GST refunds may also receive refunds earlier, if assessed to be of lower risks.\n\nFurthermore, businesses would have access to the array of value-added services provided by the InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions, which help to ease tax compliance. IRSPs are able to build validation checks into the submission process to detect wrongful GST charges from non-GST registered suppliers. These can be done by calling IRAS\u2019 Check GST Register API and checking the validity of the supplier\u2019s GST registration number based on invoice parameters before triggering alerts on the issuance of the invoice or potential wrongful GST charges to the party who processes the invoice, thus helping businesses to avoid incorrect input tax claims.\n\nIn the longer term, as adoption and usage of InvoiceNow by GST-registered businesses increase, it would open up the possibility for the development of new value-added services, e.g. pre-filing \u201chealth check\u201d report on potential errors or pre-filing assistance provided by IRSPs to help businesses, particularly those with simpler business model, to complete and submit GST returns directly to IRAS, with greater ease. This would help redefine and elevate businesses\u2019 GST compliance experience.\n\nCurrent experience\n\nPossible redefined experience with increased InvoiceNow adoption\n\nGST Return preparation\n\n\u2022 Separate effort to check for wrongful charging of GST by non-GST suppliers\n\n\u2022 Perform own checks on GST transactions before filing\n\nGST Return filing\n\n\u2022 Manually prepare and check GST returns against their GST transactions before filing on IRAS\u2019 portal\n\n\u2022 Receive automated alerts in the accounting software on wrongful GST charging from non-GST suppliers when invoices are received\n\n\u2022 Receive pre-filing \u201chealth check\u201d report in the accounting software on potential errors\n\n\u2022 More assurance to business that GST returns are accurate, with fewer discrepancies.\n\n\u2022 Pre-filing assistance provided by IRSP to help businesses complete and submit returns directly to IRAS.\n\nPost-filing audits or refunds\n\n\u2022 Audit selection based on aggregated data (in GST returns) and risk attributes\n\n\u2022 Less likely for businesses with low compliance risk to get selected for audit, due to IRAS\u2019 better risk analysis capabilities.\n\n\u2022 If audited, additional time to extract, prepare and submit listings/documents\n\n\u2022 If audited, shorter audit turnaround time and faster resolution\n\nPhased Adoption of GST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nGST-registered businesses will be required to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement progressively, starting with mandatory participation by the following groups of businesses:\n\n(a) From 1 Nov 2025, for newly incorporated companies that register for GST voluntarily. The newly incorporated companies refer to companies that are incorporated within 6 months from the time they submit their application for GST registration to IRAS.\n\n(b) From 1 Apr 2026, for all new voluntary GST registrants, regardless of incorporation date or business constitution.\n\nThe above mandatory participation is not applicable to new compulsory GST registrants.\n\nThe GST InvoiceNow Requirement will be implemented as an additional condition for voluntary GST registration. Businesses that need to comply with the requirement will need to obtain a Peppol ID before they apply to IRAS for voluntary GST registration.\n\nA soft launch for early adoption will commence from 1 May 2025. IRAS encourages all GST-registered businesses and businesses applying for GST registration on/after 1 May 2025 to transmit invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nWe strongly recommend all GST-registered businesses and businesses that intend to register for GST to come onboard early and plan ahead for the adoption of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to be compatible with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nThere are plans to progressively extend mandatory participation to new compulsory GST registrants and remaining GST-registered businesses. We will continue to consult industry partners and carefully review the feedback received before announcing further details.\n\nBusinesses that Register for GST Voluntarily from 1 Apr 2026\n\nYou will need to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement if you are applying for voluntary GST registration on or after 1 Apr 2026.\n\nPlease see example below that illustrates the above condition.\n\nExample 3\n\nCompany C was incorporated on 1 Jan 2024. It is applying for voluntary GST registration on 15 Apr 2026.\n\nAs Company C\u2019s application date for voluntary GST registration is after 1 Apr 2026, Company C is required to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nBusinesses Excluded from the GST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nWe recognise that there are practical difficulties for certain groups of businesses to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement. Hence, we have excluded the following businesses from the requirement:\n\nExcluded Businesses\n\nOverseas entities\n\nBusinesses that are liable to register for GST wholly due to the Reverse Charge regime\n\nRefers to entities belonging outside Singapore for GST purposes, including those that are required to appoint local agents (i.e. section 33(1) agents) to handle their GST matters.\n\nThis includes Overseas Vendors that are registered for GST under the Overseas Vendor Registration (\u201cOVR\u201d) Pay-only regime and OVR full regime.\n\nRefers to businesses that are liable to register for GST solely by virtue of the imported services that they are making, and/or importation of Low-Value Goods (\u201cLVG\u201d) due to reverse charge (\u201cRC\u201d) rules. \n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, businesses that make some RC transactions but did not register for GST solely by virtue of the RC rules will not be classified as \u201cExcluded Businesses\u201d. Such businesses will need to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nPlease refer to Annex D for more details on determining whether your business qualifies as an Excluded Business.\n\nHow Invoice Data will be Transmitted to IRAS\n\nBroadly, there are four types of submissions for transmitting invoice data to IRAS:\n\nType of submission\n\nDescription\n\nType 1A Submission\n\nSupply transaction made by the supplier within the InvoiceNow network\n\nType 1B Submission\n\nCorresponding purchase transaction received by the customer within the InvoiceNow network from the supply transaction under Type 1A Submission above\n\nPeppol/Solution-extracted invoice submission method\n\nPeppol invoice\n\nSolution-extracted invoice\n\nType 2 Submission\n\nSupply transaction made outside the InvoiceNow network\n\nSolution-extracted invoice\n\nType 3 Submission\n\nPurchase transaction made outside the InvoiceNow network\n\nSolution-extracted invoice submission method\n\nSolution-extracted submission method\n\nSolution-extracted submission method\n\nType 1A and 1B Submissions: Supply Transaction and Corresponding Purchase Transaction made within InvoiceNow Network\n\nFor a supply transaction made within the InvoiceNow network (e.g., where both the GST-registered supplier and the customer are connected to IRAS via the InvoiceNow network), the transmission of the invoice data to IRAS occurs in the following manner:\n\nType 1A Submission: Supply Transaction made within InvoiceNow Network (i.e., Peppol Invoice)\n\n(a) GST-registered supplier issues a Peppol invoice for a supply transaction using its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution via the InvoiceNow network and sends the invoice to its Access Point.\n\nIRSPs that have built in validation checks on wrongful GST charges would detect invoices from suppliers that wrongly charge GST and trigger an alert to the sender (i.e. the supplier) for his attention. For more information on this, please refer to the \u201cValidation Checks\u201d section.\n\n(b) Supplier\u2019s AP forwards the invoice to the customer\u2019s Access Point.\n\n(c) Once the invoice data is successfully sent to the customer\u2019s Access Point, a copy of the Peppol invoice will be transmitted to IRAS automatically.\n\n(d) Customer\u2019s Access Point forwards the invoice to the customer.\n\nType 1B Submission: Corresponding Purchase Transaction received by the Customer within InvoiceNow Network from the Supply Transaction under Type 1A Submission (i.e., Solution-extracted Invoice)\n\n(e) GST-registered customer receives, validates and accepts the invoice in its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nThis would include indicating the appropriate GST Category Code(s) for purchases, the taxable purchase amount and input tax amount that the customer wishes to claim. The practice is in line with the typical process today when businesses record their purchases in their accounting systems.\n\n(f) A copy of the recorded purchase invoice is transmitted to IRAS by way of a Solution-extracted invoice through the customer\u2019s Access Point.\n\nType 2 Submission: Supply Transaction made outside InvoiceNow Network (i.e., Solution-extracted invoice)\n\nFor a supply transaction made outside the InvoiceNow network (e.g., where the customer is not on the InvoiceNow network, or where the transactions are made using point-of-sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) systems or to customers who are individuals), the transmission of the invoice data to IRAS occurs in the following manner:\n\n(a) GST-registered supplier issues a paper/PDF invoice for the supply transaction to the customer and records the transaction in its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nIRSPs that have built in the validation check on wrongful GST charges, which would help detect invoices from suppliers that wrongly charge GST and trigger an alert to the sender (which in this case is the supplier) for his attention.\n\n(b) A Solution-extracted invoice for the supply transaction is submitted to the supplier\u2019s Access Point.\n\n(c) Supplier\u2019s Access Point transmits the Solution-extracted invoice to IRAS.\n\nType 3 Submission: Purchase Transaction made outside InvoiceNow Network (i.e., Solution-extracted invoice)\n\nFor a purchase transaction made outside the InvoiceNow network (e.g., where the GST-registered supplier is not on the InvoiceNow network, or where the transaction(s) involve petty cash purchases (or PCPs), the transmission of the invoice data to IRAS occurs in the following manner:\n\n(a) The GST-registered customer receives a paper/PDF invoice for the purchase transaction and records the transaction in its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nIRSPs that have built in the validation check on wrongful GST charges, which would help detect invoices from suppliers that wrongly charge GST and trigger an alert to the sender (which in this case is the customer) for his attention.\n\nThe customer sends a Solution-extracted invoice for the purchase transaction to its Access Point.\n\nCustomer\u2019s Access Point transmits the Solution-extracted invoice to IRAS.\n\nTransmitting Credit Notes\n\nFrom time to time, suppliers may issue credit notes to their customers to adjust the taxable value and GST amount in the original invoices, for example, to correct mistakes in the original invoices or to adjust for sales discounts/rebates. Invoice data on such credit note transactions needs to be transmitted to IRAS as well.\n\nThe approach for transmitting credit notes would be the same as the approach for transmitting invoice data stated in paragraphs 6.2 to 6.4 above. More details on how to perform the submission of credit notes can be found in the \u201cInvoicing Guidance for Common GST Scenarios\u201d section test.\n\nScope of Invoice Data to Transmit\n\nTo simplify the data collection rules under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement, GST-registered businesses are required to transmit to IRAS invoice data that is reported in the GST return, other than specific excluded transactions (\u201cExcluded Transactions\u201d).\n\nIn general, such Excluded Transactions have no underlying supplies or purchases but are reported solely for GST purposes (e.g. deemed supplies), or the value and timing of invoice data to be submitted to IRAS are difficult to determine (in the case of supplies of financial services).\n\nWhat Businesses need to transmit under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement:\n\n+ All standard-rated supplies\n+ All zero-rated supplies\n+ All exempt supplies\n+ All standard-rated purchases\n+ All zero-rated purchases\n\u2013 Excluded Transactions\n\nPlease refer to the tables below for more details.\n\nInvoice Data Reported in the GST Return \u2013 Mandatory to Transmit to IRAS\n\nType Supplies/Purchases\n\nStandard-rated supplies\n\nExamples of Data to Transmit\n\nLocal sales of goods and services:\n\n\u2022 Supplies where GST is disregarded or suspended under certain GST schemes e.g., Approved Contract Manufacturer and Trader\n\nGST Category Codes\n\n\u2022 SR\n\u2022 NA\n\u2022 SRCA-S\n\u2022 SROVR-RS\n\u2022 SROVR-LVG\n\nZero-rated supplies\n\n\u2022 Export sales of goods\n\u2022 Provision of international services\n\u2022 Sale or lease of residential properties\n\u2022 Local sale of investment precious metals\n\n\u2022 ZR\n\u2022 ES33\n\u2022 ESN33\n\nStandard-rated purchases\n\n\u2022 Purchases with input tax claims, e.g. purchase of business inventories from GST-registered suppliers\n\u2022 Purchases where input tax is directly attributable to Regulation 33 exempt supplies and non-Regulation 33 exempt supplies\n\u2022 Purchases where input tax claims are residual in nature\n\u2022 Purchases under certain GST schemes e.g. GMS, AMFT and Approved 3rd Party Logistics Company (\u201cA3PL\u201d) scheme\n\u2022 Purchases where Customer Accounting is applied\n\n\u2022 TX\n\u2022 TX-ESS\n\u2022 TX-N33\n\u2022 TX-RE\n\u2022 TXNA\n\u2022 TXCA\n\nZero-rated purchases\n\n\u2022 Purchase of goods that are exported\n\u2022 Purchase of international services e.g. international freight charges, IDD calls\n\n\u2022 ZP\n\nExcluded Transactions \u2013 Excluded from Scope\n\nType of Supplies/Purchases\n\nStandard-rated supplies\n\nTransactions to Exclude\n\n\u2022 Deemed supplies (e.g. free goods)\n\u2022 Reverse charge supplies on which businesses are required to account GST\n\nZero-rated supplies\n\n\u2022 Goods exported without actual sales\n\u2022 All exempt financial services that qualify for zero-rating\n\u2022 All exempt digital payment tokens (\u201cDPT\u201d) that qualify for zero-rating\n\nExempt supplies\n\n\u2022 All exempt financial services\n\u2022 All exempt DPTs, such as:\n- Exchange of DPTs for fiat currency or other DPTs\n- Loan of DPTs\n\nStandard-rated purchases\n\n\u2022 Import permits for importation of goods\n\u2022 Reverse charge purchases on which businesses are entitled to input tax claims\n\u2022 Goods and services purchased by overseas headquarters (or overseas branches) of a Singapore branch\n\nInvoice Data Not Reported in the GST Return \u2013 Excluded from Scope\n\nType of Supplies/Purchases\n\nOut-of-scope supplies\n\nTransactions to Exclude\n\nAll out-of-scope supplies, such as:\n\n\u2022 Third country sales of goods\n\u2022 Services supplied by overseas headquarters or branches\n\nType of Supplies/Purchases\n\nExcluded transactions for GST purpose, such as carbon credits, regulatory fees, transfer of business as a going concern\n\nNon-reportable purchases\n\nAll non-reportable purchases, such as:\n\n\u2022 Purchases from non-GST registered suppliers\n\u2022 Purchases where input tax is blocked e.g. motor car expenses\n\u2022 Purchases that are exempted from GST\n\u2022 Out-of-scope purchases from GST-registered suppliers\n\nList of GST Category Codes Accepted by IRAS\n\nA comprehensive list of GST category codes accepted by IRAS can be found in Annex E.\n\nThis standardised set of GST category codes is provided to enable businesses to classify their supply and purchase transactions. Businesses are encouraged to incorporate the standardised set of GST category codes into their InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions or systems and use it to tag their transactions for submission to IRAS.\n\nSome businesses may wish to continue to use their internal tax codes as per their current business processes. Such businesses will have to work with their IRSPs or APs to map their internal tax codes to the list of accepted GST category codes before submitting the invoice data to IRAS.\n\nSubmission of Invoice Data with Supplies that Fall Within and Outside the Scope\n\nIf the invoice or credit note has a line item that pertains to invoice data that falls within the scope of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement above, then the invoice data relating to the entire invoice or credit note must be transmitted to IRAS under the requirement.\n\nExample 4\n\nCompany D issues a tax invoice to its tenant for the following:\n\n\u2022 A one-month refundable security deposit\n\u2022 Lease rental for Apr to Jun 2026\n\nIt charges and accounts GST solely on the lease rental. The refundable security deposit is outside the scope of GST.\n\nAs the invoice contains a standard-rated supply, which is within the scope, Company D is required to transmit the entire invoice data to IRAS.\n\nOption to Transmit All Supplies and Purchases Invoice Data\n\nBusinesses may opt to transmit invoice data on transactions that fall outside the scope of the requirement if doing so eases their compliance burden. For instance, businesses may opt to transmit to IRAS invoice data relating to all transactions, including out-of-scope supply transactions, rather than to exclude the latter. Businesses will need to work with IRSPs (if applicable) and APs to enable this.\n\nSubmission of Purchase Invoice Data where Input Tax is not Claimed in Full\n\nIf the businesses incur any purchases with input tax for both business and non-business purposes, they should submit the purchase invoice data for the claimable portion only. Businesses can do this by applying the relevant GST category code for the claimable portion for submission to IRAS. Alternatively, businesses may choose to submit the entire invoice for ease of compliance. The businesses should adopt its chosen approach for its invoice data submissions consistently.\n\nExample 5\n\nCompany E incurs mobile phone expenses amounting to S$7,000 (before GST), and GST of S$630. As the mobile phone expenses are incurred for both business and personal calls, Company E wishes to apply a proxy of 4/7 to apportion the portion of the expense as incurred for business purpose.\n\nAssuming the general input tax claiming conditions are met, strictly speaking, Company E should apply the GST category code TX and submit S$4,000 as the value of standard-rated purchases and S$360 as the amount of input tax to IRAS as its purchase invoice data under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nAlternatively, Company E may choose to submit S$7,000 as the value of standard-rated purchases and S$630 as the amount of input tax even if Company E only claims 4/7 of the mobile phone expenses, if doing so eases compliance. However, Company E must apply the same approach consistently for all its input tax that is not claimed in full.\n\nOption to Submit Invoice Data on an Aggregated Basis\n\nBusinesses may not be able to submit certain invoice data at a transactional level. They are thus allowed to aggregate their transactions before transmitting to IRAS for the following scenarios:\n\n(a) Supplies made via point-of-sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) systems e.g. cash registers;\n\n(b) Supplies where simplified tax invoices (\u201cSTI\u201d) are issued. Serially numbered receipts are considered as STI transactions; or\n\n(c) Petty cash purchases (\u201cPCP\u201d) e.g. staff claims and purchases using corporate cards.\n\nOnly POS, STI and PCP transactions can be submitted to IRAS on an aggregated basis. Businesses are not allowed to aggregate any other transactions for submissions to IRAS.\n\nAggregated invoice data will be sent to IRAS in the form of solution-extracted invoices.\n\nExample 6\n\nCompany F is a retail store which issues serially printed receipts via its POS system to its customers. As the customers are not on InvoiceNow network, the receipts are not issued via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nTo transmit the invoice data on the supplies made to IRAS, Company F may aggregate the daily POS sales and record the information into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution as one single solution-extracted invoice for transmission to IRAS at a regular interval and before the submission due date.\n\nAs the invoice is submitted on an aggregated basis, certain mandatory data elements (\u201cMDEs\u201d) may be defaulted to \u201cPOS\u201d.\n\nExample 7\n\nCompany G adopts an employee expense system where staff claims are processed into its accounting system on a weekly basis.\n\nTo transmit the invoice data on the purchases to IRAS, Company G may aggregate the employee expenses and record the information into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution as a single solution-extracted invoice for transmission to IRAS at a regular interval (weekly in Company G\u2019s case) and before the submission due date.\n\nFor more details on how to complete the Mandatory Data Elements (\u201cMDEs\u201d) for the submission of aggregated invoice data, refer to the relevant examples at Annex A (for supplies invoice data submissions) and Annex C (for purchases invoice data submissions) respectively.\n\nBulk Submission of Invoice Data\n\nBusinesses will be able to perform bulk submissions of invoice data to IRAS via API. Each bulk submission data package can contain a maximum of 10 documents of the same invoice type (e.g. up to 10 invoices or 10 credit notes) and each data package should not be more than 10 MB in total data size.\n\nBusinesses may speak to their AP and/or IRSP to find out more on how they can perform bulk submissions.\n\nDue Date for Transmitting Invoice Data\n\nThe supplies or purchase invoice data must be transmitted to IRAS by the earlier of:\n\n(a) The date on which the relevant GST return is filed; or\n\n(b) The filing due date of the relevant GST return.\n\nThe \u201crelevant GST return\u201d refers to the GST return covering the prescribed accounting period when the date of the transaction occurs.\n\nThe date of the transaction is determined as follows:\n\nTypes of Transaction\n\nDate of Transaction\n\nSupplies data\n\nFor a supply where an invoice is or to be issued, the date of transaction would be the issuance date of the document; and\n\nFor all other supplies, the date of transaction would be the date the transaction is posted into the accounting system.\n\nPurchases data\n\nFor a purchase where the supplier\u2019s invoice or an equivalent document is to be issued, the date of transaction would either be the:\n\n(a) Issuance date of the document; or\n\n(b) Date the transaction is posted into the accounting system.\n\nFor all other purchases, the date of transaction would be the date the transaction is posted into the accounting system.\n\nIRAS recommends that data extraction be carried out regularly (e.g. daily or weekly).\n\nExample 8\n\nCompany H issues a tax invoice to its customer on 20 Mar 2026 and files the GST return for prescribed accounting period 1 Jan to 31 Mar 2026 on 20 Apr 2026.\n\nAs the date of transaction is based on invoice date, the transaction falls within the prescribed accounting period 1 Jan to 31 Mar 2026. Company H must submit the invoice data relating to the supply of goods to the customer by 20 Apr 2026, which is the earlier of the filing date (20 Apr 2026) or filing due date (30 Apr 2026).\n\nExample 9\n\nCompany J receives a tax invoice dated 20 Mar 2026 and files GST return for the prescribed accounting period 1 Jan to 31 Mar 2026 on 15 May 2026. Company J is late in filing as the filing due date is 30 Apr 2026.\n\nAs the date of transaction is based on invoice date, the transaction falls within the prescribed accounting period 1 Jan to 31 Mar 2026. Company J must submit the invoice data relating to this purchase by 30 Apr 2026, which is the earlier of the filing date (15 May 2026) or filing due date (30 Apr 2026).\n\nAdvance Payments\n\nBusinesses may receive advance payments from their customers, before tax invoices are issued.\n\nThe business does not need to create a separate invoice to submit the invoice data at the time the advance payment is received. It may submit the invoice data to IRAS subsequently when the invoice is issued to the customer.\n\nExample 10\n\nCompany K issues a pro-forma invoice to Company L for the collection of advance payment. Company K will only issue the tax invoice when the goods are ready for delivery to Company L.\n\nAs the pro-forma invoice is not considered a bill of payment, Company K is not required to submit the invoice data when it issues the pro-forma invoice or receives the advance payment from Company L. Company K will submit the invoice data to IRAS only when it issues the tax invoice.\n\nSubmission of Invoice Data before the Business is GST-registered, i.e. Pre-registration GST claims\n\nBusinesses are required to submit invoice data for transactions that fall on and after the date the business become GST-registered.\n\nAs such, businesses are not required to submit invoice data for pre-registration GST claims on purchases. Nonetheless, businesses are required to maintain proper records and documentary evidence to support their pre-registration claims.\n\nExample 11\n\nCompany M is GST-registered with effect from 1 Jun 2026. It has received tax invoices with GST charged and has made payment for them prior to its GST registration. It will claim these pre-registration GST claims in its first GST return for the prescribed accounting period 1 Apr to 30 Jun 2026.\n\nNotwithstanding that Company M will be making the pre-registration GST claims in its GST return, Company M is not required to submit the invoice data relating to pre-registration GST claims under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nSubmission of Invoice Data after the Business Ceased to be GST-registered\n\nBusinesses are required to submit invoice data for transactions up to the last day of their GST-registration. Supplies made by a business that has cancelled its GST registration may straddle its GST de-registration date. For example, the business may supply a service or deliver goods before its de-registration date but issues an invoice and receives payment for that service only after it has de-registered from GST. While the business must account for the output tax on the supply in its final GST F8 return, the business is not required to submit the invoice data relating to this supply to IRAS, if the invoice is issued after the business has ceased to be GST-registered. Nonetheless, the businesses are required to maintain proper records and documentary evidence to support their supplies and purchases straddling their GST de-registration date.\n\nExample 12\n\nCompany N sells and delivers goods worth S$10,000 on 20 Jun 2027 before it was de-registered from GST on 1 Jul 2027. The final GST F8 return covers the prescribed accounting period 1 Apr to 30 Jun 2027.\n\nAs the invoice was issued after Company N ceased to be GST-registered, Company N is not required to submit the invoice data to IRAS.\n\nBusinesses may also receive invoices that are dated after their GST de-registration date, for supplies of services performed or goods delivered/made available before their GST de-registration date.\n\nThe business is not required to submit the invoice data relating to this purchase, if the invoice date falls outside the business\u2019s GST registration period.\n\nExample 13\n\nCompany O receives a supplier\u2019s tax invoice dated 5 Jul 2027 for services rendered on 20 Jun 2027. Company O was de-registered from GST with effect from 1 Jul 2027 and the final GST F8 return covers the prescribed accounting period 1 Apr to 30 Jun 2027.\n\nAs the invoice is dated after Company O has ceased to be GST-registered, Company O is not required to submit the invoice data to IRAS.\n\nMandatory Data Elements\n\nIRAS has identified a set of essential data elements that must be present in the invoice data sent to IRAS. This set of data elements is in line with the existing GST content requirements of a tax invoice and other invoices set out by the Comptroller under Regulations 11 and 13 of the GST (General) Regulations of the GST Act and facilitates the use of the invoice data for tax administration purposes.\n\nWhen transmitting invoice data to IRAS, the supplies and purchase invoices and credit notes must contain the following mandatory data elements (\u201cMDEs\u201d):\n\nMDEs present in both Invoice and Credit Note\n\nSupplier Details\n\nSupplier Endpoint ID\n\nSupplier Scheme ID\n\nSupplier ID\n\nSupplier GSTN\n\nSupplier Tax Scheme ID\n\nCustomer Details\n\nSupplier Name\n\nSupplier Address \u2013 Address Line 1\n\nSupplier Address \u2013 Postal Code\n\nSupplier Address \u2013 Country Code\n\nCustomer Endpoint ID\n\nCustomer Scheme ID\n\nCustomer ID\n\nCustomer Name\n\nCustomer Address \u2013 Address Line 1\n\nCustomer Address \u2013 Postal Code\n\nCustomer Address \u2013 Country Code\n\nMDEs present in Invoice\n\nCustomization ID\n\nInvoice Line Identifier\n\nProfile ID\n\nItem Name\n\nDoc UUID\n\nUnit\n\nInvoice Number\n\nQuantity\n\nItem Net Price\n\nInvoice Issue Date\n\nInvoice Type Code (i.e., invoice or credit note)\n\nItem GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nInvoice Line Net Amount\n\nSum of Invoice Line Net Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Taxable Amount\n\nTotal GST Amount\n\nTotal Invoice Amount without GST\n\nTotal Invoice Amount with GST\n\nItem GST Category Code\n\nSubtotal GST Category Code\n\nAmount due for Payment\n\nInvoice Currency Code\n\nItem GST Category Rate\n\nMDEs present in Credit Note\n\nCustomization ID\n\nUnit\n\nProfile ID\n\nQuantity\n\nDoc UUID\n\nCredit Note Number\n\nCredit Note Currency Code\n\nCredit Note Date\n\nItem Net Price\n\nTotal Credit Note Amount without GST\n\nTotal Credit Note Amount with GST\n\nAmount due for Payment\n\nInvoice Type Code (i.e., invoice or credit note)\n\nItem Name\n\nItem GST Category Code\n\nSubtotal GST Category Code\n\nInvoice Note\n\nItem GST Category Rate\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nTo enable businesses to better understand how the MDEs are to be filled for the different types of invoice data to be transmitted, we have provided examples for common invoicing scenarios in the Annexes for reference:\n\nSupplies Transactions (Refer to Annex A)\n\n(a) Peppol invoices (under Type 1A Submission)\n\n(b) Solution-extracted invoices (under Type 2 Submission)\n\n(c) Aggregated POS or STI transactions (under Type 2 Submission)\n\nPurchase Transactions (Refer to Annex B)\n\n(d) Solution-extracted invoices (under Type 1B or Type 2 Submission)\n\n(e) Aggregated PCP transactions (under Type 2 Submission)\n\nCredit Notes (Refer to Annex C)\n\n(f) Credit notes issued by business (under Type 1A or Type 2 Submission)\n\n(g) Credit notes received by business (under Type 1B or Type 3 Submission)\n\nCustomer\u2019s UEN Information\n\nBusinesses would need to collect their customer\u2019s information, e.g. Customer UEN (i.e. customer\u2019s business registration number), Customer Name and Customer Address, which are mandatory data elements for submission to IRAS. If the customers are individuals, businesses can indicate \u201cNA\u201d in both the Customer Name and Customer UEN fields. When indicating the details of overseas customers, businesses must indicate the customer\u2019s overseas business registration number. Businesses must maintain supporting documents to substantiate the customer information as part of their recording keeping.\n\nPeppol Invoices Issued Without the Words \u201cTax Invoice\u201d\n\nAlthough Peppol invoices issued by the supplier (under Type 1A Submission) and received by the customer (under Type 1B Submission) under the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution do not contain the words \u201cTax Invoice\u201d, IRAS is prepared to accept the invoices as valid tax invoices which businesses may use to support their GST input tax claims. This is on the condition that all the other contents required on a tax invoice, as specified under Regulation 11 of the GST (General) Regulations are present. Any input tax claims by the business will also be subject to the normal input tax claiming conditions for GST.\n\nOn the other hand, for all other invoice data submitted to IRAS (i.e. under Type 2 and 3 Submission), the underlying invoices issued and received remain as the source document. In this regard, the words \u201cTax Invoice\u201d must be shown on the underlying invoices in order for the supplier to fulfil Regulation 11 of the GST (General) Regulations, and for the customer to fulfil the normal input tax claiming conditions. When transmitting such solution-extracted invoices to IRAS, businesses need not indicate the words \u201cTax Invoice\u201d on the invoices.\n\nValidation Checks\n\nData Schema Validation Check\n\nIRSPs and GST-registered businesses submitting invoice data to IRAS must implement a data schema validation check to ensure that the data entered is compliant with the mandatory data elements. Schematron files are available for IRSPs and GST-registered businesses to use to validate their invoice data submissions and ensure they conform with the regular XML structure.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, IRAS has not imposed any validation check between the invoice level amounts and the line level amounts on invoices. This is because solutions used by businesses may handle rounding differences on invoices differently. For example, some solutions may round the amounts at the line level, while others may round the amounts at the invoice level.\n\nPlease speak to your IRSPs or APs or your in-house enterprise solution providers to facilitate the development of your solution.\n\nValidation Check on Wrongful GST Charges\n\nIRSPs and GST-registered businesses are recommended to build the validation check on wrongful GST charges feature in their InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. This check utilises invoice data such as the Supplier GSTN, Invoice Date and GST Amount and data returned from the IRAS\u2019 Check GST Register API to detect invoices that wrongly charge GST.\n\nImplementing this validation check will ease tax compliance, and give businesses the assurance that the GST charges are legitimate. For more information, please speak to your AP or IRSP to find out how they can support you in this work.\n\nInvoicing Guidance for Common GST Scenarios\n\nIssuing Credit Notes\n\nA GST-registered business may issue a credit note to adjust the taxable value and GST amount in the original invoices previously issued and submitted to IRAS (e.g. over-billings, incorrectly zero-rated a transaction that cannot qualify for zero-rating). Invoice data relating to credit notes is to be sent to IRAS under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nExample 14\n\nCompany P makes a local supply of customised tools and heavy machinery to Company Q. As Company Q is not on the InvoiceNow network, Company P issues a sales invoice in PDF to Company Q and submits the supply invoice data to IRAS under Type 2 submission.\n\nSubsequently, Company Q returned the customised tools to Company P due to poor workmanship, and Company P agreed to provide a full refund.\n\nAs the monetary value of the supply has changed, Company P must issue a credit note to Company Q, and submit the credit note data to IRAS under Type 2 submission.\n\nIn the case of adjustment to a standard-rated supply, if both the supplier and customer choose not to adjust the GST amount charged on the original invoices in the credit note and fulfil the conditions for doing so, the supplier may do so and submit the credit note data to IRAS accordingly. The supplier should continue to apply GST Category Code \u201cSR\u201d, even if the GST amounts are not adjusted.\n\nIf the supplier wishes to cancel an invoice, the business may issue a credit note to do so. To cancel the invoice, the amounts and GST category codes on the credit note would need to tally with the MDEs of the original invoice.\n\nWhen issuing or recording the credit note, the business must ensure that all the required MDEs of a credit note are filled. The business should, where possible, indicate the number and date of the original invoice in the following MDE fields Preceding Invoice Number (IBT-025) and Preceding Invoice Date (IBT-026) when submitting credit note data to IRAS. If the business is unable to identify the original invoice, these fields may be left blank. However, it must maintain documentary evidence that it has accounted for GST on the original supply.\n\nReceiving Credit Notes\n\nBesides issuing credit notes, a GST-registered business may, in the course of business, receive credit notes from its supplier as well. The business will need to receive, validate and accept the invoice in its solution. This would include indicating the appropriate purchase GST category code(s), taxable purchase amount and input tax amount that the customer wishes to claim.\n\nPlease refer to Annex C for illustrations on how the data elements are to be populated for credit notes issued or received for submission to IRAS.\n\nMaking Resubmissions to IRAS\n\nAfter the invoice has been issued and submitted to IRAS, a GST-registered business may at times need to perform adjustments that do not affect the monetary values on the invoice (e.g. updating the Invoice Note, change in GST category code from ZR to ES33 etc.) recorded in its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. For such transactions, the business will have to send the revised invoice to IRAS using the same Document UUID contained in the original invoice, which is part of the functionality within InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions. Please speak to your IRSP or AP on how the resubmission process works within your InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nIRAS will regard the last invoice or credit note submitted by the business to be the latest submission and use that record for tax administration purposes.\n\nWhere the adjustments are made via the issuance of a credit note, such adjustments would not constitute a resubmission.\n\nExample 16\n\nCompany T makes a local supply to Company U. As both companies are on the InvoiceNow network, Company T issues an invoice to Company U through the InvoiceNow network and submits the supply invoice data to IRAS under Type 1A submission.\n\nSubsequently, Company U notices that the goods delivery address indicated on the invoice is incorrect, and requests Company T to revise and resend the invoice to Company U.\n\nAs there is no change to the monetary value of the supply, Company T may amend and send the revised invoice (using the Document UUID of the original invoice) to Company U through the InvoiceNow network. Company T may do so by performing a resubmission of the supply invoice data to IRAS under Type 1A submission.\n\nIf Company U has not processed and submitted the incorrect invoice as purchase invoice data to IRAS under Type 1B submission, Company U may simply submit the revised invoice as purchase invoice data to IRAS under Type 1B submission. Otherwise, Company U may need to resubmit both the original invoice and the revised invoice as purchase invoice data to IRAS under Type 1B submission.\n\nErrors made in Processing Solution-extracted Invoices\n\nWhere there are errors in the solution-extracted invoices processed after the data has been submitted to IRAS (e.g. typographical errors in the invoice value), businesses will have to send the revised invoice to IRAS using the same Document UUID contained in the original invoice.\n\nExample 17\n\nWhen processing an invoice from a supplier, Company V wrongly entered and submitted a purchase invoice data of S$100 to IRAS.\n\nTo rectify this mistake, Company V amends the GST amount of the supplier\u2019s invoice that was previously recorded in the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. As amendment is made to the invoice data submitted to IRAS previously, Company V needs to resubmit the invoice data to IRAS using the same Document UUID of the original invoice.\n\nExample 18\n\nCompany W incorrectly keyed in the GST category code of \u201cTX\u201d instead of \u201cZP\u201d when processing a zero-rated purchase invoice and submitted the invoice data to IRAS.\n\nTo rectify this mistake, Company W amends the GST category code of the zero-rated purchase invoice recorded in the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nAs the amendment is made to the invoice data submitted to IRAS previously, Company W needs to resubmit the invoice data to IRAS using the same Document UUID of the original invoice.\n\nIssuing Invoices in Foreign Currency\n\nA GST-registered business may issue invoices denominated in foreign currency. When doing so, certain non-mandatory data elements such as Tax currency code, Invoice total without GST in tax currency (SGD), Invoice total with GST in tax currency (SGD), Total GST amount in tax currency (SGD) should also be filled in.\n\nExample 19\n\nCompany X makes a local sale of goods to an overseas company amounting to US$1,000 (or S$1,350), with GST charged.\n\nIn the supplies invoice data to be submitted to IRAS, Company X should indicate the following:\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission) or Solution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nInvoice Currency Code\n\nTax Currency Code\n\nTotal Amount without GST (USD)\n\nCurrency ID for Invoice Total Amount without GST\n\nTotal GST Amount in invoice currency (USD)\n\nCurrency ID for Total GST Amount\n\nTotal Amount with GST (USD)\n\nCurrency ID for Total Amount with GST\n\nTotal Amount without GST in tax currency (SGD)\n\nTotal GST amount in tax currency (SGD)\n\nCurrency ID for Total GST Amount\n\nTotal Amount with GST in tax currency (SGD)\n\nThe business does not need to provide the exchange rate in the invoice but it must use the approved exchange rates specified in the e-Tax Guide \u201cExchange Rates for GST Purpose\u201d to convert the foreign currency to SGD.\n\nInvoice Submissions with Multiple Line Items involving a mix of Taxable and Non-Taxable Transactions\n\nA GST-registered business may at times issue invoices with multiple line items with different GST treatments and GST category codes. Such invoice data may be submitted to IRAS as a single invoice.\n\nExample 20\n\nCompany Y makes the following sales of goods to the customer:\n\nDescription\n\n5 hats, delivered locally\n\n8 shirts, delivered locally\n\n10 pairs of shoes, exported from Singapore to overseas\n\nGST category code\n\nSR\n\nSR\n\nZR\n\nTotal value of goods (before GST, if applicable)\n\nS$100\n\nS$200\n\nS$400\n\nCompany Y may issue and submit the supply invoice data as a single tax invoice to IRAS.\n\nIn the supply invoice data submission, Company Y may indicate the following information accordingly at the line-item, subtotal and total levels:\n\nAt the line-item level\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission) or Solution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nInvoice Line Identifier\n\nQuantity\n\nUnit\n\nInvoice Line Net Amount\n\nCurrency ID for Invoice Line Net Amount\n\nItem Name\n\nItem GST Category Code\n\nItem GST Category Rate\n\nItem GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nItem Net Price\n\nFor the hats\n\n1\n\n5\n\nPC\n\n100.00\n\nSGD\n\n20.00\n\nFor the shirts\n\n2\n\n8\n\nPC\n\n200.00\n\nSGD\n\n25.00\n\nFor the shoes\n\n3\n\n10\n\nPC\n\n400.00\n\nSGD\n\n0.00\n\nAt the subtotal level\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission) or Solution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nSubtotal GST Category Taxable Amount\n\nCurrency ID for Subtotal GST Category Taxable Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Amount\n\nCurrency ID for Subtotal GST Category Tax Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Code\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nSubtotal GST Category Rate\n\nFor all standard-rated supplies\n\n300.00\n\nSGD\n\n27.00\n\nSGD\n\nSR\n\nGST\n\nFor all zero-rated supplies\n\n400.00\n\nSGD\n\n0.00\n\nSGD\n\nZR\n\nGST\n\nAt the total level\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission) or Solution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nTotal Amount without GST\n\nCurrency ID for Invoice Total Amount without GST\n\nTotal GST Amount\n\nCurrency ID for Total GST Amount\n\nTotal Amount with GST\n\nCurrency ID for Total Amount with GST\n\nAmount due for payment\n\nCurrency ID for Amount due for payment\n\n700.00\n\nSGD\n\n27.00\n\nSGD\n\n727.00\n\nSGD\n\n727.00\n\nSGD\n\nGST Invoicing Requirements for Different Groups of Businesses\n\nThe table below provides guidance on how different groups of GST-registered businesses should complete the Sender ID, Supplier ID and Supplier GSTN fields when issuing invoices.\n\nScenarios\n\nGST invoicing requirements\n\nGuidance to fill in the invoice/credit note MDEs\n\nEntity is a company\n\nThe company should reflect its GSTN on invoices that it issues to charge and account for GST on taxable supplies that it makes\n\n\u2022 Sender ID (from SBDH envelope): To use the Peppol ID registered under the UEN of the company.\n\n\u2022 Supplier ID (IBT-030): To indicate the UEN of the company.

For these scenarios, please refer to the guidance below.\n\nScenario\n\nGST invoicing requirements\n\nGuidance to fill in the invoice/credit note MDEs\n\nDiscounted Sale Price Scheme\n\nInvoices to indicate that GST charged is computed at 50% of the sale price.\n\nGross Margin Scheme\n\nBoth the supplier and the customer will need to send to IRAS the tax invoice issued/received with:\n\n\u2022 Invoice Note (IBT-022): To indicate a remark stating that the transaction is under \u201cDiscounted Sale Price Scheme\u201d.\n\nThe supplier that issues the tax invoice will need to send to IRAS:\n\n\u2022 GST Category Code (IBT-118, IBT-151): To indicate as \u201cNA\u201d.\n\n\u2022 GST Category Rate (IBT-119, IBT-152): To indicate as \u201c0\u201d.\n\nSelf-billing (Buyer Created Tax Invoice)\n\n(a) To reflect \u201cBuyer Created Tax Invoice \u2013 Approved by Comptroller of GST\u201d in lieu of the term \u201cTax Invoice\u201d\n\n(b) A statement to inform your supplier to account for the GST as output tax \u2013 \u201cThe tax shown is your output tax due to the Comptroller of GST\u201d\n\nInvoice Note (IBT-022): To include a remark stating that the transaction is under \u201cGross Margin Scheme\u201d.\n\nBoth the customer-cum-issuer and the supplier-cum-recipient must take into account the following:\n\n\u2022 Invoice Note (IBT-022): To indicate remarks stating that the invoice is a \u201cBuyer Created Tax Invoice\u201d and \u201cThe tax shown is your output tax due to the Comptroller of GST\u201d.\n\nInvoices for self-billing can only be issued outside the InvoiceNow network and are to be transmitted to IRAS by the solution-extracted submission method. If the supplier records the self-billing invoices and transmits invoice data to IRAS by generating invoices from its own accounts receivable module, some of the invoice data transmitted may differ from the self-billing invoices issued by the customer. In such a case, the supplier must be able to trace the invoice data transmitted to the self-billing invoices and provide such records upon request.\n\nCustomer Accounting for Prescribed Goods\n\nThe tax invoice is to reflect:\n\n(a) Customer\u2019s GST registration number; and\n\n(b) A statement stating \u201cSale made under customer accounting. Customer to account for GST of $x\u201d or \u201cCustomer accounting: Customer to pay GST of $X to IRAS\u201d\n\nThe customer accounting tax invoice will need to send to IRAS:\n\n\u2022 Customer GSTN (IBT-048): To indicate the Customer\u2019s GSTN.\n\n\u2022 Invoice Note (IBT-022): To indicate a remark stating either that the transaction is a \u201cSale made under customer accounting.

Company BB is required to apply customer accounting on this sale to Company CC.\n\nCompany BB is required to submit to IRAS the invoice data of the customer accounting tax invoice issued to Company CC, based on the MDEs in the sample illustration in Annex A, and taking into account the following:\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nInvoice Note\n\nSubtotal GST Category Code\n\nSubtotal GST Category Rate\n\nItem GST Category Code\n\nItem GST Category Rate\n\nTotal Amount without GST\n\nTotal GST Amount\n\nTotal Amount with GST\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission) or Solution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nSale made under customer accounting.

Customer is to account for GST of S$945.\n\nTXCA\n\n9\n\nTXCA\n\n9\n\n10,500.00\n\n945.00\n\n11,445.00\n\nCompany CC must still account for the output tax according to the prevailing customer accounting rules and may claim the input tax in its GST returns according to the general input tax claiming rules.\n\nOther Administrative Matters\n\nData Reconciliation between the Invoice Data Submitted to IRAS and Figures Reported in the GST return\n\nBusinesses should do their due diligence to ensure that the invoice data submitted tally with what they submit in their GST returns. However, IRAS recognises that legitimate differences could arise due to reasons such as:\n\n(a) Timing differences \u2013 e.g. where time of supplied is triggered by payment, and invoices are issued after the filing of GST return; supplies straddling GST registration, etc.\n\n(b) Supplies where invoices are not required \u2013 e.g. deemed supplies and Reverse Charge\n\n(c) Purchases where input tax are not claimed or not claimed in full, e.g. input tax subject to attribution or apportionment\n\n(d) Correcting errors in F5 instead of filing F7\n\nBusinesses will not be penalised so long as they adhere to the record keeping requirements and are able to produce these records upon request to substantiate their GST reporting and invoice data submissions.\n\nImplications to GST Group Registration\n\nA new voluntary GST registrant may apply to be included into an existing GST group. If the new voluntary GST-registered entity is included into an existing GST group once it is GST-registered, the entire GST group will be subjected to the GST InvoiceNow Requirement at a later phase, to be announced in future.\n\nExample 23\n\nOn 1 Apr 2026, Company DD intends to apply for voluntary GST registration and to join its parent company under an existing GST group registration.\n\nIn this case, Company DD will be subject to GST InvoiceNow Requirement at a later phase, based on the timeline for the entire GST group, which will be announced in the future.\n\nWhen sending invoice data to IRAS, the GST group can either transmit invoice data separately (as individual members of the group), or on a consolidated basis (by the representative member of the GST group).\n\nThere could be instances where a GST group consists of an Excluded Business as a group member. In such cases, the invoice data of the Excluded Business need not be transmitted to IRAS under the requirement. The GST group may also choose to submit all invoice data to IRAS, including invoice data belonging to the Excluded Business, if doing so eases their compliance burden.\n\nEven if the invoice data is transmitted by each individual member, there is no change to the GST reporting requirement for entities under the GST group, i.e. the GST group will continue to report their GST return on a consolidated basis.\n\nImplications to Partially Exempt Businesses\n\nLike any other GST-registered businesses, partially exempt businesses are required to submit invoice data on purchases with input tax claims to IRAS.\n\nHowever, partially exempt businesses that fail the De Minimis rule are required to perform input tax attribution and apportionment, and they may satisfy the De Minimis Rule in some accounting periods and not in others. As such, these businesses may only be able to determine the actual input tax that are claimable at the end of each accounting period and tax year for longer period adjustments (where applicable).\n\nTo ease compliance, such partially exempt businesses may opt to submit all their purchase invoice data as part of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement, whether or not the input tax is claimed (partially or in full) and reported in the GST return. The businesses are not required to make any retrospective adjustments to the purchase invoice data at the end of the accounting period (or for longer period adjustments) based on the actual input tax claims submitted in the GST return.\n\nAPI Service Interruption\n\nIn the event that there is an API service interruption (e.g. when API call is interrupted in-transit, or when you receive no response or experience unexpected error while processing the submission), the InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions are designed with an exponential backoff retry approach to automatically perform the submission retries. Businesses may approach their APs or IRSPs for more information about the exponential backoff retry approach.\n\nIf businesses are not able to make the submission after performing several rounds of retries, they will have to submit their invoice data when the API service resumes. Businesses will be given sufficient time to make the submission.\n\nDuring the API service interruption, businesses can continue to transact with their customers and suppliers via the InvoiceNow network or outside the network, as this process is independent from the submission process to IRAS.\n\nBusinesses are also encouraged to put in place sufficient measures in their business continuity plans to cater for any unforeseen circumstances and activate them accordingly when the need arises.\n\nPreparing Early to Adopt GST InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions\n\nBusinesses are encouraged to come onboard early and plan ahead for the adoption of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions or make changes to their in-house enterprise solutions to be compatible with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement by taking the steps listed below.\n\nBetween Now to Apr 2025:\n\nStep 1: Ensure that your solution is InvoiceNow-Ready\n\nBusinesses with existing accounting or finance solutions, or businesses that are planning to purchase one, can check whether their preferred solution is listed on IMDA\u2019s accredited InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Providers (\u201cIRSPs\u201d) list. They may also consider adopting free solutions with basic InvoiceNow capabilities.\n\nLarge enterprises using their own in-house solutions may get in touch with an IMDA-accredited Access Point Provider to get connected to the InvoiceNow network.\n\nStep 2: Register for InvoiceNow and obtain a Peppol ID\n\nBusinesses may approach their IRSP or AP to register themselves in the SG Peppol Directory with their UEN and obtain a Peppol ID.\n\nFrom May 2025 onwards:\n\nStep 3: Ensure that your business can transmit invoice data successfully to IRAS\n\nBusinesses may enable the GST InvoiceNow Submission feature and test their system.\n\nTypes of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions\n\nOff-the-shelf accounting and finance solutions that are integrated with InvoiceNow capabilities to ensure that the business can successfully transmit invoices directly from its InvoiceNow-Ready solution to IRAS.\n\nContact the IRSP if you need assistance on how to do so.\n\nIn-house enterprise solutions\n\nContact the AP to ensure that the solution is connected to IRAS via API and that the GST InvoiceNow Submission feature is enabled.\n\nTest the invoice data transmission to IRAS with the AP, ensuring that the business receives transaction reports from the AP notifying if the invoice data submission is successful.\n\nBusinesses should allow 3 to 12 months for system connection and testing.\n\nContact Information\n\nFor enquiries on this e-Tax Guide, please contact the Goods and Service Tax Division at www.iras.gov.sg (select \u201cContact Us\u201d).\n\nAnnex A \u2013 Sample Examples of Supplies Invoice Submissions\n\nFor detailed explanation on the MDEs, you may refer to Invoice Data Submission API Interface Specs on the GST InvoiceNow Requirement available at APEX portal. We strongly advise you to reach out to your AP and/or IRSP. You may work with your AP or IRSP to auto-populate the values for applicable MDEs.\n\nNotes:\n\n\u2022 For submission of aggregated invoice data for supplies (i.e. aggregated POS or STI transactions), businesses are to indicate \u201cPOS\u201d or \u201cSTI\u201d (as the case may be) for certain MDEs when recording the aggregated invoice data in the InvoiceNow solution for the transmission to IRAS.\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission)\n\nSolution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nAggregated POS or STI transactions (Type 2 submission)\n\nIBT-024\n\nCustomization ID\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#conformant# urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:international:sg:3.0\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#conformant# urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:LocalTaxInvoice:sg:1.0\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#conformant# urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:LocalTaxInvoice:sg:1.0\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:pint:billing-1@sg-1\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:pint:billing-1@sg-1:LocalTaxInvoice:sg:1.0\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:pint:billing-1@sg-1:LocalTaxInvoice:sg:1.0\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\nIBT-023\n\nProfile ID\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:01:1.0\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:01:1.0\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:01:1.0\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:bis:billing\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:bis:billing\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:bis:billing\n\nIBT-001\n\nInvoice Number\n\nINV001\n\nINV001\n\nINV001\n\nBT-SG-003\n\nDoc UUID\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\nbfeac3d0-82d8-4195-9d88-53b3547f83a3\n\nbfeac3d0-82d8-4195-9d88-",

        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions for GST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nGST-registered businesses will be required to use InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to transmit invoice data directly to IRAS for tax administration. This will be done in phases, starting with mandatory participation by the following group of businesses:\n\na) From 1 November 2025, for newly incorporated companies (incorporated within 6 months from the time they submit their application for GST registration) that apply for voluntary GST registration.\n\nb) From 1 April 2026, for all businesses that apply for new voluntary GST registration, regardless of incorporation date or business constitution.\n\nA soft launch will commence from 1 May 2025. IRAS encourages all GST-registered businesses and businesses applying for GST registration on/after 1 May 2025 to transmit invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nWe have published the e-Tax Guide \u201cAdopting GST InvoiceNow Requirement for GST-registered Businesses\u201d to provide details on the GST InvoiceNow Requirement. This set of Frequently Asked Questions supplements the e-Tax Guide and should be read in conjunction with it.\n\n1. Phased implementation of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\n1.1 Implementation timeline\n\nAre the implementation timelines that have been announced (i.e. 1 Nov 2025 and 1 Apr 2026) applicable only to businesses applying for GST registration on a voluntary basis? When are existing GST-registered businesses and new compulsory GST registrants required to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement?\n\n1.2 Testing environment\n\nIs there a testing environment to test my system implementation and ensure that I can successfully transmit invoice data to IRAS before the mandated timelines?\n\n1.3 GST InvoiceNow submission feature\n\nI am an existing GST-registered business that does not wish to be an early adopter. Does that mean if the GST InvoiceNow submission feature is not activated, the Peppol invoices that are currently issued to my customers will not be transmitted to IRAS?\n\n1.4 Businesses that register for GST voluntarily from 1 Apr 2026\n\nMy business was incorporated on 1 May 2001 and registered for GST from 1 Jan 2002. As my business was dormant, I applied for cancellation of GST registration and my business was de-registered from GST on 1 May 2025. The implementation timelines of 1 Nov 2025 and 1 Apr 2026 apply to new voluntary GST registrants only. IRAS will publish more information on the implementation timeline for existing GST-registered businesses and new compulsory GST registrants when available. Meanwhile, all GST-registered businesses are encouraged to plan ahead for the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\n1.5 Insufficient supporting documents for compulsory GST registration on/after 1 Apr 2026\n\nOn 15 Apr 2026, I applied for compulsory GST registration as I forecast the taxable turnover of my business to exceed $1 million in the next 12 months. However, as I was unable to provide sufficient documents to support my forecast, my business was registered for GST on a voluntary basis. Do I have to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement?\n\n2. Scope of GST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\n2.1 Transmission of purchase invoice data to IRAS\n\nMy supplier has transmitted the sales invoice data through the InvoiceNow network to IRAS. Since IRAS would already have the sales invoice data from my supplier, why do I need to submit the corresponding purchase invoice data to IRAS?\n\nAs your application for GST registration submitted on 15 Apr 2026 was approved on a voluntary basis and not on a compulsory basis due to insufficient evidence to support your $1 million sales forecast, you are required to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement. Transmitting purchase invoice data relating to standard-rated purchases and zero-rated purchases to IRAS serves to substantiate your purchases and input tax claims reported in your GST return. This is no different from today where businesses are required to report their standard-rated purchases and zero-rated purchases in the GST return and submit such data to IRAS when businesses are selected for audit. Do note that the purchase invoice data submitted may be different from the sales invoice data submitted by the suppliers, as businesses will also need to provide additional information in the purchase submission process, such as the amount of input tax to be claimed.\n\n2.2 Pre-registration GST claims and bad debt relief claims\n\nAre the following transactions within the scope of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement: Pre-registration GST claims and Bad debt relief claims?\n\nInvoice data relating to pre-registration GST claims falls outside the scope of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement as such purchases were typically made by businesses before they were registered for GST or had adopted the GST Requirement. Nonetheless, businesses must maintain proper records and documentary evidence to support their pre-registration claims. Bad debt relief claims also fall outside the scope of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement, as no additional invoices are issued or received with respect to these claims. Likewise, the repayment of bad debt relief claims subsequently recovered would also fall outside the scope.\n\n2.3 Recovery of expenses from related entity without any issuance of invoices\n\nThe recovery of expenses from your related entity would be regarded as a reimbursement and constitutes a supply for GST purposes. I had incurred expenses as a principal and recovered the same from my local related entity by way of offsetting our accounts receivables and payables balance. I did not issue any invoice for the recovery of expenses to my related entity. Do I need to transmit the data on the recovery of expenses to IRAS?\n\n2.4 GST-registered businesses that are subject to reverse charge\n\nI had procured services from overseas suppliers. As I am a partially exempt business that is unable to claim input tax in full, I am required to apply reverse charge and account for GST on the imported services. Am I exempted from the GST InvoiceNow Requirement?\n\n2.5 Request to be exempted from the GST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nCan the following group of businesses request to be exempted from the GST InvoiceNow Requirement? a) Businesses that wholly make supplies to related entities b) Small businesses, or businesses with low transaction volume c) Businesses that wholly make zero-rated exempt supplies\n\nHence, even though there is no actual issuance of invoice nor actual payment received, you are required to transmit the invoice data of such recovery of expenses to IRAS when the transaction is posted into your accounting system. Only businesses that are liable to register for GST solely by virtue of the imported services that they are making and/or importation of Low-Value Goods due to reverse charge rules, are exempted from the GST InvoiceNow Requirement. This should not be confused with businesses that register for GST under the normal GST registration rules regime but make reverse charge transactions. Such businesses are still required to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement. \n\nNo, these businesses are required to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement. There is a need to transmit invoice data relating to zero-rated and standard-rated purchases to substantiate the taxable purchases and input tax reported in the business\u2019s GST return. For small businesses or businesses with low transaction volume, IRAS and IMDA are working with InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Providers to ensure low-cost InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions available in the first few years of implementation for businesses to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement. A list of InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Providers offering free-of-charge solution packages for transmitting invoices for GST administration purposes will be made available on the IRAS website by May 2025.\n\n3. Transmission of Invoice Data\n\n3.1 InvoiceNow transmission methods\n\nWhat is the difference between the Peppol submission method and the Solution-extracted submission method for transmitting invoice data to IRAS? The key difference between the Peppol submission method and the Solution-extracted submission method lies in how the invoice data is created and transmitted. In the Peppol submission method, both seller and buyer must be on the InvoiceNow network, before the seller can send the Peppol invoice to the customer through the network. A copy of the Peppol invoice data will be automatically transmitted to IRAS, if the GST InvoiceNow submission feature has been activated. In contrast, the Solution-extracted submission method is used for (i) non-Peppol invoices issued outside the InvoiceNow network for supplies (e.g. paper/PDF invoices) and recorded into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution; and (ii) purchase invoices that are recorded into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. These invoice data are first recorded into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution and subsequently transmitted to IRAS on a regular basis.\n\n3.2 Conversion of PDF / paper invoices by Access Point Providers\n\nCan I send PDF copies of the invoices or paper invoices to my Access Point Providers, so that they can convert them into the required Peppol format for transmission to IRAS? Access Point Providers are not able to convert PDF copies of the invoices or paper invoices to Peppol format. You will need to record and send the invoice data to IRAS via the Solution-extracted submission method.\n\n3.3 Transmission of invoice data relating to debit note\n\nI have issued a debit note to my local related entity to recover expenses and this recovery is subject to GST at the prevailing rate. How do I transmit data relating to the debit note to IRAS? You should not issue a debit note in place of a tax invoice when making a standard-rated supply to a GST-registered business. If you have issued a debit note for other transactions, as part of your business practice, you can do so and send such data as invoices to IRAS via the Solution-extracted submission method, using the current invoice document. InvoiceNow does not support the transmission of debit note via the network. Businesses can choose to aggregate the following transactions on a regular basis before transmitting to IRAS: (a) Supplies made via point-of-sale systems e.g. cash registers (b) Supplies where simplified tax invoices or serially numbered receipts are issued (c) Petty cash purchases e.g. staff claims and purchases using corporate cards.\n\n3.5 Issuance of invoices by overseas shared service centre on behalf of the GST-registered supplier\n\nI am using an overseas shared service centre to issue invoices to my customers in Singapore. Can the overseas shared service centre connect to the InvoiceNow network to issue and transmit invoices on my behalf? The overseas shared service centre may submit the sales invoice data to IRAS on your behalf by using a suitable InvoiceNow-Ready Solution or by connecting their enterprise solution to the InvoiceNow network via an IMDA-accredited Access Point Provider. When sending the invoice data, the overseas shared service centre needs to ensure that you are indicated as the \u201cSupplier\u201d of the invoice data. For example, your UEN should be indicated in the Supplier ID (IBT-030). You may wish to reach out to your InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Provider or Access Point Provider to find out more about how to enable this use case.\n\n3.6 Supply of imported goods from overseas principal to section 33(2) agent\n\nI had imported goods into Singapore as a section 33(2) agent on behalf of my overseas principal and had supplied the goods to myself. Do I have to transmit invoice data on the supply of goods by the overseas principal to myself as well as for the corresponding purchases to IRAS? To ease compliance, the Comptroller has waived the requirement for section 33(2) agent to issue tax invoices to itself for the supply of goods by the overseas principal to the agent itself. We are prepared to extend this waiver such that the agent is not required to transmit the invoice data specifically for such supply and the corresponding purchases. For clarity, the agent is still required to issue tax invoices for goods sold by the agent to its local customers and transmit the invoice data to IRAS under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\n3.7 Character limit and maximum file size\n\nIs there a specified character limit for each data element/field? What is the maximum file size for the transmission? Please note that the total XML file size must not exceed 10MB per submission. There is no limit on the number of line items per invoice. However, we recommend keeping it to no more than 999-line items per invoice.\n\n3.8 Maximum number of line items per invoice\n\nWhat is the maximum number of line items that can be included in a single invoice? Please note that the total XML file size must not exceed 10MB per submission.\n\n4. Mandatory Data Elements\n\n4.1 Invoicing customers that are not on InvoiceNow network\n\nFor invoices issued to customers not on the InvoiceNow network, am I required to collect details such as Customer Name, Customer UEN and Customer Address from my customers (including overseas customers) for submission to IRAS? Do I have to validate the customer\u2019s details? Yes, you are required to collect customer\u2019s details such as Customer Name, Customer UEN and Customer Address as these are mandatory data elements of invoice data for submission to IRAS. Nonetheless, if your customers are non-GST registered individuals, you can indicate \u201cNA\u201d in both the Customer Name and Customer UEN fields. For overseas customers, you must indicate their overseas business registration/identification numbers as the Customer UEN. There is no need for you to validate the customer details as you will be relying on the information provided by the customer to make the invoice data submission to IRAS. However, you must maintain supporting documents to substantiate the customer information as part of your record keeping.\n\n4.2 Mapping of internal tax codes\n\nI currently use my own internal tax codes in my accounting software to tag my purchases and supplies. Do I need to replace them with IRAS\u2019 list of prescribed GST category codes? You can continue to use your internal tax codes. However, you will need to map your internal tax codes to IRAS\u2019 list of prescribed GST category codes in order to submit the invoice data to IRAS. Alternatively, you can also adopt IRAS\u2019 list of prescribed GST category codes to tag your transactions moving forward. You may wish to speak to your IMDA-accredited Access Point Provider or InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Provider to find out how they can support you in this work.\n\n4.3 Peppol invoices meeting tax invoice requirements for GST purposes\n\nMy supplier has issued Peppol invoices to me through the InvoiceNow network. Although the Peppol invoices issued by your supplier through the InvoiceNow network do not contain the words \u201cTax Invoice\u201d, IRAS is prepared to accept the Peppol invoices as valid tax invoices which you may use to support your input tax claims. This is on the condition that all the other contents required on a tax invoice, as specified under Regulation 11 of the GST (General) Regulations are present. You must also ensure that you satisfy all other normal input tax claiming conditions.\n\n5. Making resubmissions\n\n5.1 Re-classification of GST category code of purchase invoice\n\nI initially submitted a purchase invoice as a standard-rated purchase at the point of processing. However, during GST return preparation, my company decided not to claim the input tax in the GST return and re-classified the GST category code from TX (taxable) to OP (out-of-scope) in my InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. Do I need to perform a resubmission to IRAS in view of the re-classification?\n\n5.2 Invoice data on standard-rated purchase submitted when input tax is not claimed\n\nI submitted an invoice data on standard-rated purchase with the GST category code TX to IRAS at the point of processing the invoice. Subsequently, I did not include the input tax in the GST return, as it did not satisfy the input tax claiming conditions. Do I need to resubmit the invoice data to IRAS?\n\n5.3 Issuance of credit note with no GST adjustment\n\nI have issued a credit note to my customer and we have agreed not to adjust the GST amount charged on the original tax invoice. Do I still need to submit the credit note data to IRAS? Notwithstanding that there is no adjustment in the GST amount charged on the original tax invoice, you are still required to submit the credit note data to IRAS. You must use the same GST category code applicable to the original tax invoice (i.e., \u201cSR\u201d) when you submit the credit note data.\n\n6. Invoicing Guidance for Common Scenarios\n\n6.1 Issuance of credit notes for volume rebates to my customer\n\nI have issued a credit note for a volume rebate to my customer for making purchases exceeding a certain amount. When I submit the credit note data to IRAS, do I have to indicate all the numbers and dates of the original tax invoices? You should state the numbers and dates of the original tax invoices in the Preceding Invoice Number (IBT-025) and Preceding Invoice Date (IBT-026) fields. However, if you are unable to identify the original tax invoices (e.g. the volume rebates cannot be identified with a particular tax invoice), you may leave the fields blank. You must maintain other documentary evidence that you have accounted for GST on the original supplies.\n\n6.2 Invoicing customers in foreign currencies\n\nI have issued a commercial invoice in foreign currency for a zero-rated supply. Do I have to convert the value of the zero-rated supply into Singapore dollars equivalent when I submit the invoice data to IRAS? You are required to convert all invoice data that are required for GST reporting in foreign currencies to their Singapore dollar equivalents, for submission to IRAS. Please refer to the e-Tax Guide for details to fill in the mandatory data elements for invoices issued in foreign currencies.\n\n6.3 GST category codes for invoice with different types of supplies\n\nI am issuing an invoice that includes both standard-rated and zero-rated supplies to my customer via the InvoiceNow network. Can I use multiple GST category codes for this single invoice data submission to IRAS? Yes, a single invoice can have multiple line items, each with its own GST category code. This means one invoice can contain several different GST category codes. Please refer to the e-Tax Guide for an example of an invoice with multiple GST category codes.\n\n6.4 Self-billing transactions\n\nI am under a self-billing arrangement with my customer. Do I need to transmit invoice data on self-billing transactions via InvoiceNow to IRAS? Invoices for self-billing transactions are to be transmitted to IRAS by way of the Solution-extracted submission method (as they can only be issued outside the InvoiceNow network). The customer-cum-issuer of the self-billing invoice must submit the invoice data to IRAS under Type 2 Submission, whereas the supplier-cum-recipient must submit the invoice data under Type 3 Submission. Please refer to the e-Tax Guide for the details to fill in the mandatory data elements for self-billing scenario.\n\n7. GST Group Registration\n\n7.1 Submission of GST return and invoice data for entities within GST group\n\nAre entities under GST group registration still required to report their GST return on a consolidated basis, even though invoice data is transmitted to IRAS at the individual entity level? Yes, entities under GST group registration will continue to report their GST return on a consolidated basis.\n\n7.2 GST registration process for GST group registration\n\nWith the introduction of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement, are there any changes to the GST registration application process for GST group registration following the scenarios: i) Addition of new voluntary GST registrants into an existing GST group ii) Addition of overseas entity into an existing GST group? There are no changes to the GST registration application process for GST group registration. The new voluntary GST registrant or overseas entity may apply to be included into an existing GST group. If a new voluntary GST-registered entity is included into an existing GST group, the entity will be subjected to the GST InvoiceNow Requirement based on the phase for the GST group. If any of the entities in the GST group are Excluded Businesses (e.g. overseas entity), only the Excluded Businesses need not transmit their invoice data to IRAS.\n\n8. Pilot Experience on Invoice Data Submission\n\n8.1 Learning points from the pilot\n\nWhat are the key findings and lessons learned from the pilot? Through the pilot, IRAS identified the following areas for improvement in the invoice data submitted: 1. Poor data quality due to absence of validation checks in the submission process 2. No single standard in the GST category tax codes used 3. Duplicate submission of invoice data to correct invoice data originally submitted 4. Incomplete transmission of invoice data due to limitations in system design of certain InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions. IRAS had provided more details on the recommended validation checks, acceptable GST category codes, and the handling of resubmission of invoice data in the e-Tax Guide. Businesses should also work closely with Access Point Providers and/or InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Providers to build the recommended validation checks into the submission process and ensure that their InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions are configured with the correct GST category codes for submission of invoice data.\n\n9. Obligations and Penalties\n\n9.1 Reconciliation of invoice data with figures in the GST return\n\nDo I need to reconcile the invoice data with the figures submitted in the GST return? Will I be penalised for discrepancies between invoice data and GST return declarations? Businesses should perform due diligence to ensure that the invoice data submitted tally with what they submit in their GST returns. However, IRAS recognises that legitimate differences could arise due to reasons such as: (a) Timing differences \u2013 e.g. where time of supplies triggered by payment, and invoices are issued after the filing of GST return; (b) Supplies where invoices are not required \u2013 e.g. deemed supplies and Reverse Charge; (c) Purchases where input tax are not claimed or not claimed in full, e.g. input tax subject to attribution or apportionment; (d) Correcting errors in F5 instead of filing F7. Businesses will not be penalised so long as they adhere to the record keeping requirements and are able to produce these records upon request to substantiate their GST reporting and invoice data submissions.\n\n9.2 Choice to opt out of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nCan I opt out of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement? Will there be penalties for non-compliance (e.g., non-submission, late submission of invoice data, errors/mistakes on the invoice)? All GST-registered businesses will be required to transmit invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions via the InvoiceNow network, except for Excluded Businesses (i.e. overseas entities and entities that are registered wholly due to the Reverse Charge Regime). This requirement will be implemented progressively, starting with newly incorporated companies that apply for GST registration on a voluntary basis from 1 Nov 2025, and any business that applies for voluntary GST registration from 1 Apr 2026. Your GST application may not be approved or your GST registration status may be revoked if you do not comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement. IRAS recognises that businesses require time to adapt to the GST InvoiceNow Requirement and will be calibrated in our enforcement approach during the initial phases of onboarding, especially for genuine mistakes or errors in invoice data that are not due to negligence or made without reasonable excuse.\n\n9.3 Filing of GST returns and keeping of business records\n\nDo businesses still need to file GST returns and keep records if they submit invoice data to IRAS? The GST InvoiceNow Requirement does not preclude businesses from their existing GST responsibilities. GST-registered businesses must continue to file their GST returns and keep proper business and accounting records.\n\n10. Data Protection and Privacy\n\n10.1 Security of InvoiceNow network\n\nIs the InvoiceNow network secure? The InvoiceNow network is implemented with security measures in place. Firstly, only IMDA-accredited Access Point Providers are allowed to operate on the network and are authorised with a PKI certificate issued by Open Peppol who is the governing authority. Secondly, the transmitted data is protected with SSL transport layer security such that the data is sent through the secured and encrypted channel in the InvoiceNow network. Thirdly, the transmitted data is signed using the Access Point Providers\u2019 authorised PKI certificate to ensure that the data is genuine and non-repudiable. Lastly, any receiving Access Point Providers will check the signature of sending Access Point Providers to ensure that they are authorised on the network before they accept the data.\n\n10.2 Retention Period\n\nWhat are the data protection measures that have been put in place to safeguard the invoice data that is received by IRAS, including the retention period of the data? The IRAS system that receives invoice data employs a multi-layered approach to ensure the security of our API integration. This includes robust authentication and authorisation mechanisms to verify the identity of Access Point Providers (APs) accessing the Invoice Data Submission API through the APEX portal. Data transmitted through the API is encrypted to protect it from cybersecurity threats such as unauthorised access or data breaches. Role-based access control also governs access to specific API functionalities and data. Additionally, regular security audits and testing are conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, and compliance with industry standards and regulations is maintained. Continuous monitoring processes are in place to detect and respond to security incidents in real time, to monitor and log all data access activities, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the API integration and data transmitted. Similar to the tax information collected by IRAS, IRAS is bound by secrecy laws and may disclose such information to third parties only for reasons permitted by law. Please refer to our Data Protection Statement and Privacy Statement for more information on how we handle the data that you have entrusted to us safely.\n\n11. Grants and Support\n\n11.1 Acquiring InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions\n\nAre there any grants or support available for businesses to acquire InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions? IRAS and IMDA are committed to help businesses navigate the regulatory requirements and embrace digital solutions. Businesses using IMDA-accredited InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Providers may also be eligible to apply for the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) and receive up to $30,000 for IT solutions and InvoiceNow-Ready equipment, including solutions. IRAS and IMDA are also working closely with InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Providers (\u201cIRSP\u201d) to provide Free-of-Charge (\u201cFOC\u201d) solution packages for businesses to adopt. These FOC solution packages aim to reduce businesses\u2019 costs associated with complying with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement and the expenses related to integrating their existing system infrastructure with InvoiceNow. A list of IRSPs offering FOC solution packages for transmitting invoices to IRAS for GST administration purposes will be made available by May 2025.",

Such written permission must also be obtained before any part of this publication is stored in a retrieval system of any nature.\n\nAdopting GST InvoiceNow Requirement for GST-registered Businesses\n\nAim\n\nThis e-Tax Guide explains the requirement for GST-registered businesses to transmit invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions by leveraging the InvoiceNow network (\u201cGST InvoiceNow Requirement\u201d). The Guide also provides details to support GST-registered businesses to adopt the requirement.\n\nYou should read this Guide if:\n\n(a) you are required to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement as an additional condition to be voluntarily registered for GST; or\n\n(b) you do not fall within the GST InvoiceNow Requirement but would like to take up an InvoiceNow-Ready Solution to transmit invoice data to IRAS via the InvoiceNow network as an early adopter.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to be a technical specification for the GST InvoiceNow Requirement or for InvoiceNow. For system architects, software developers and IT support personnel of Access Points Providers, Solution Providers and businesses using their own in-house enterprise solutions, the relevant technical documents are available at APEX portal and IMDA\u2019s InvoiceNow Technical Playbook. These documents provide details on the solutioning and cover the system implementation know-how.\n\nAt a Glance\n\nWith the announcement of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement, GST-registered businesses will be required to use InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to send invoice data directly to IRAS for tax administration. This will be done in phases, starting with the new voluntary GST registrants. The transmission of invoice data to IRAS will be done seamlessly through IMDA-accredited Access Point Providers via Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) technology.\n\nThis move is in line with international trends, with governments worldwide actively promoting the adoption of e-invoicing for tax administration. The phased adoption of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement follows a pilot by IRAS, IMDA, businesses and service providers between Sep 2020 and Jun 2023.\n\nTo allow businesses sufficient lead time to prepare, the GST InvoiceNow Requirement will be implemented in a calibrated and progressive manner as follows:\n\n(a) From 1 Nov 2025, for newly incorporated companies (incorporated within 6 months from the time they submit the application for GST registration) that apply for voluntary GST registration.\n\n(b) From 1 Apr 2026, for all new voluntary GST registrants, regardless of incorporation date or business constitution.\n\nA soft launch will commence from 1 May 2025, allowing non-mandatory participation from any existing GST-registered businesses and those applying for GST registration on/after 1 May 2025 that wish to be early adopters to transmit invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nAdopting InvoiceNow will help businesses better fulfil their responsibilities as GST-registered businesses, by facilitating record-keeping, billing, and payment processes. In particular, it supports new GST-registered businesses to get their compliance right from the start.\n\nThere are plans to progressively extend mandatory participation to new compulsory GST registrants and remaining GST-registered businesses. We will continue to consult industry partners and carefully review the feedback received before announcing further details.\n\nGlossary\n\nInvoiceNow refers to Singapore\u2019s nationwide e-invoicing network that is based on the international standard called \u201cPeppol\u201d. It connects all businesses and facilitates the transmission of invoices within the InvoiceNow network in a standardised manner.\n\nThe GST InvoiceNow Requirement is a joint initiative between IRAS and IMDA to digitalise invoicing and facilitate the submission of invoice data by GST-registered businesses to IRAS by leveraging the InvoiceNow network. GST-registered businesses that are required to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement will be required to use InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to send invoice data to IRAS for tax administration.\n\nThe data to be transmitted covers all data on invoices or equivalent documents that serve as bills for payment (or adjustments of bill for payment) for supplies and purchases made. Below are some examples of such documents:\n\nDocuments that serve as bill for payment (considered as invoice data)\n\n\u2022 Sales invoice\n\u2022 Tax invoice\n\u2022 Simplified tax invoice\n\u2022 Serially numbered receipts\n\u2022 Debit notes\n\u2022 Credit notes\n\nThe above documents are collectively referred to as \u201cinvoice\u201d, and their data are referred to as \u201cinvoice data\u201d in this e-Tax Guide.\n\nIn situations where a supply or purchase does not entail the issuance of an invoice, businesses should still transmit the data that they record into their accounting system. This could happen, for example, when related entities make supplies to each other but opt to settle by offsetting their accounts receivable/payable in lieu of issuing invoices and making payment.\n\nInvoiceNow-Ready Solutions are accounting and finance software that facilitate the transmission of invoices between businesses via the InvoiceNow network. They can be purchased off-the-shelf or be customised specifically for businesses in the form of proprietary enterprise resource planning systems.\n\nInvoiceNow-Ready Solutions connected to IRAS through IMDA-accredited Access Points will enable the transmission of invoice data to IRAS via API technology. IMDA will publish the list of IMDA-accredited InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions that are connected to IRAS by May 2025.\n\nIRSPs are providers offering accounting or finance solutions which are connected to the InvoiceNow network via IMDA-accredited Access Points.\n\nAPs create and maintain the connectivity gateways i.e. Access Points that function as access nodes on the InvoiceNow network; they also ensure compliance to the Peppol standards and routing of invoices to the correct destination Access Points.\n\nThe differences between an IRSP and an AP are summarised below:\n\nRole\n\nIRSP\n\nAP\n\nWhat services do they provide?\n\n\u2022 Build the software features to support the GST InvoiceNow Requirement and connectivity to the Access Points\n\n\u2022 Connect IRSPs and businesses with in-house enterprise solutions to the InvoiceNow network\n\n\u2022 Businesses will have to rely on separate accounting or finance solutions to perform accounting and finance functions\n\n\u2022 IRSPs provide solutions with different capabilities, ranging from simple and free-of-charge invoicing functions to a full suite of accounting and finance functions\n\nA Peppol invoice refers to an invoice created and transmitted from the supplier to the customer through the InvoiceNow network. Both the supplier and the customer must be on the InvoiceNow network before the supplier can issue a Peppol invoice to the customer.\n\nIn the Peppol submission method, a copy of the Peppol invoice data is automatically transmitted to IRAS when the Peppol invoice is routed from the supplier to the customer through the InvoiceNow network.\n\nA solution-extracted invoice refers to:\n\n(a) A non-Peppol invoice issued outside the InvoiceNow network for supplies and recorded into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. Non-Peppol invoices include paper/PDF invoices issued to individuals or customers who are not on the network.\n\n(b) A purchase invoice that is recorded into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nIn the solution-extracted submission method, a copy of the solution-extracted invoice data is automatically extracted from the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution and transmitted to IRAS regularly (e.g. daily or weekly).\n\nThe Peppol ID is the unique address that enables companies, organizations, and authorities to receive business messages, such as e-invoices and e-orders, via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nThe SG Peppol Directory is a facility for searching Singapore businesses that are registered on the InvoiceNow network. The SG Peppol Directory allows businesses to search for other companies registered on the InvoiceNow network to send and receive e-invoices electronically through the nationwide e-invoicing network.\n\nIRSPs and APs will need to assist businesses to register for Peppol ID and update the businesses\u2019 details in the Service Metadata Publisher (\u201cSMP\u201d), so that businesses can be listed on the SG Peppol Directory.\n\nInvoiceNow\n\nLaunched in 2019, InvoiceNow is a nationwide e-invoicing network that is based on the Peppol standard. Managed by Infocomm Media Development Authority (\u201cIMDA\u201d), which is appointed as Singapore\u2019s Peppol Authority, InvoiceNow aims to connect all active businesses and encourage digitalisation through the direct transmission of invoices in standard digital format between suppliers and customers, from one finance system to another.\n\nWithin the InvoiceNow network, invoices are exchanged using a common Extensible Markup Language (or \u201cXML\u201d) format known as the Business Interoperability Specification Billing 3.0 Universal Business Language (or \u201cBIS Billing 3.0 UBL\u201d). This common standard allows users to adopt their preferred solutions, while being able to exchange invoices with their partners who may not be using the same solution but are on InvoiceNow. An upgrade to the Singapore BIS Bill 3.0 UBL Specification (\u201cSG Peppol BIS 3.0\u201d) called the Singapore Peppol International (\u201cPINT-SG\u201d) Specification was launched in Feb 2024. This upgraded specification enables users to experience seamless cross-border transactions. PINT-SG is also the base data format used to support the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nThe process of sending and receiving invoices in PDF format via email is not considered e-invoicing. Even though both supplier and customer issue and receive the invoice digitally in both scenarios, the customer who receives an invoice in PDF format would still need to record the details of the invoice into its own accounting system. On the other hand, the details of the invoice issued via InvoiceNow will be transmitted directly into the customer\u2019s accounting system without human intervention. This speeds up invoice processing, which results in faster digital payment, and greatly reduces the time spent verifying invoices and receiving payment.\n\nThe illustration below gives an overview of the 4-corner model under InvoiceNow. In any given business transaction, the supplier can send its invoice directly to the InvoiceNow-Ready accounting or finance solution of the customer, using the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution of the supplier\u2019s choice. The supplier will utilise the necessary information in the SG Peppol Directory to identify the customer and create the invoice. The created invoice will be sent by the supplier (\u201cCorner 1\u201d) to the supplier\u2019s Access Point (\u201cCorner 2\u201d) to facilitate the transmission of the invoice to the customer\u2019s Access Point (\u201cCorner 3\u201d), before it is transmitted to the customer (\u201cCorner 4\u201d). Businesses on the network can use an InvoiceNow-Ready accounting or finance solution of their choice. Once connected to InvoiceNow, the business will effectively be connected to all other businesses that are on the InvoiceNow network.\n\nBenefits of using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions\n\nThe adoption of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions offers the following advantages as compared to the traditional paper or PDF-based invoicing:\n\n(a) Streamlined processes: InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions enable direct transmission of e-invoices in a structured data format across different finance systems, thereby eliminating manual work involved in sending, receipting and recording of invoices into systems.\n\n(b) Reduced errors and costs: InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions reduce manual processes, along with errors and rectification costs. With invoice records maintained electronically, such solutions also reduce invoice storage and retrieval costs.\n\n(c) Improved cashflow management: InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions facilitate quicker invoice processing and payment, helping businesses to more effectively manage their cashflow.\n\nFor more information about InvoiceNow, please refer to the InvoiceNow FAQs or visit IMDA\u2019s website www.imda.gov.sg/invoicenow.\n\nGST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nTo support the nationwide InvoiceNow initiative, and as part of our ongoing transformation efforts to digitalise with the wider ecosystem and integrate tax into taxpayers\u2019 accounting and payroll systems, GST-registered businesses will be required to use InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to send invoice data to IRAS for tax administration.\n\nHow GST InvoiceNow Requirement works\n\nUnder the requirement, GST-registered businesses will need to submit invoice data pertaining to their GST supplies and purchases to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions and via the InvoiceNow network. Invoices that are not issued using InvoiceNow (e.g. for supplies made to businesses not on the InvoiceNow network or supplies made via point-of-sale systems) should also be sent to IRAS when they are recorded in the accounting system. More details on the scope of transactions can be found in the \u201cScope of Invoice Data to Transmit\u201d section below.\n\nIRAS is connected to the InvoiceNow network, via the Access Point, to receive copies of the invoice data transmitted through the InvoiceNow network, whenever businesses transact. This is achieved through the introduction of a 5th corner to the 4-corner model under InvoiceNow.\n\nThe transmission of invoice data to IRAS will be performed via API technology. When businesses activate the GST InvoiceNow Submission feature in their InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to transmit invoice data to IRAS, IRAS will receive a copy of the invoice data whenever businesses issue or receive invoices via the InvoiceNow network, or record invoices into their InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions.\n\nAdditional benefits for adopting InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to transmit invoice data to IRAS\n\nBesides enjoying the benefits of InvoiceNow, GST-registered businesses that transmit invoice data to IRAS can also benefit from reduced compliance efforts when preparing data for submission to IRAS.\n\nWith IRAS\u2019 better risk analysis capabilities, fewer businesses would potentially be selected for GST audits. Those selected for audits may also expect shorter audits and faster resolution of the audit issues. Businesses claiming GST refunds may also receive refunds earlier, if assessed to be of lower risks.\n\nFurthermore, businesses would have access to the array of value-added services provided by the InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions, which help to ease tax compliance. IRSPs are able to build validation checks into the submission process to detect wrongful GST charges from non-GST registered suppliers. These can be done by calling IRAS\u2019 Check GST Register API and checking the validity of the supplier\u2019s GST registration number based on invoice parameters before triggering alerts on the issuance of the invoice or potential wrongful GST charges to the party who processes the invoice, thus helping businesses to avoid incorrect input tax claims.\n\nIn the longer term, as adoption and usage of InvoiceNow by GST-registered businesses increase, it would open up the possibility for the development of new value-added services, e.g. pre-filing \u201chealth check\u201d report on potential errors or pre-filing assistance provided by IRSPs to help businesses, particularly those with simpler business model, to complete and submit GST returns directly to IRAS, with greater ease. This would help redefine and elevate businesses\u2019 GST compliance experience.\n\nCurrent experience\n\nPossible redefined experience with increased InvoiceNow adoption\n\nGST Return preparation\n\n\u2022 Separate effort to check for wrongful charging of GST by non-GST suppliers\n\n\u2022 Perform own checks on GST transactions before filing\n\nGST Return filing\n\n\u2022 Manually prepare and check GST returns against their GST transactions before filing on IRAS\u2019 portal\n\n\u2022 Receive automated alerts in the accounting software on wrongful GST charging from non-GST suppliers when invoices are received\n\n\u2022 Receive pre-filing \u201chealth check\u201d report in the accounting software on potential errors\n\n\u2022 More assurance to business that GST returns are accurate, with fewer discrepancies.\n\n\u2022 Pre-filing assistance provided by IRSP to help businesses complete and submit returns directly to IRAS.\n\nPost-filing audits or refunds\n\n\u2022 Audit selection based on aggregated data (in GST returns) and risk attributes\n\n\u2022 Less likely for businesses with low compliance risk to get selected for audit, due to IRAS\u2019 better risk analysis capabilities.\n\n\u2022 If audited, additional time to extract, prepare and submit listings/documents\n\n\u2022 If audited, shorter audit turnaround time and faster resolution\n\nPhased Adoption of GST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nGST-registered businesses will be required to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement progressively, starting with mandatory participation by the following groups of businesses:\n\n(a) From 1 Nov 2025, for newly incorporated companies that register for GST voluntarily. The newly incorporated companies refer to companies that are incorporated within 6 months from the time they submit their application for GST registration to IRAS.\n\n(b) From 1 Apr 2026, for all new voluntary GST registrants, regardless of incorporation date or business constitution.\n\nThe above mandatory participation is not applicable to new compulsory GST registrants.\n\nThe GST InvoiceNow Requirement will be implemented as an additional condition for voluntary GST registration. Businesses that need to comply with the requirement will need to obtain a Peppol ID before they apply to IRAS for voluntary GST registration.\n\nA soft launch for early adoption will commence from 1 May 2025. IRAS encourages all GST-registered businesses and businesses applying for GST registration on/after 1 May 2025 to transmit invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nWe strongly recommend all GST-registered businesses and businesses that intend to register for GST to come onboard early and plan ahead for the adoption of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to be compatible with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nThere are plans to progressively extend mandatory participation to new compulsory GST registrants and remaining GST-registered businesses. We will continue to consult industry partners and carefully review the feedback received before announcing further details.\n\nBusinesses that Register for GST Voluntarily from 1 Apr 2026\n\nYou will need to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement if you are applying for voluntary GST registration on or after 1 Apr 2026.\n\nPlease see example below that illustrates the above condition.\n\nExample 3\n\nCompany C was incorporated on 1 Jan 2024. It is applying for voluntary GST registration on 15 Apr 2026.\n\nAs Company C\u2019s application date for voluntary GST registration is after 1 Apr 2026, Company C is required to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nBusinesses Excluded from the GST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nWe recognise that there are practical difficulties for certain groups of businesses to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement. Hence, we have excluded the following businesses from the requirement:\n\nExcluded Businesses\n\nOverseas entities\n\nBusinesses that are liable to register for GST wholly due to the Reverse Charge regime\n\nRefers to entities belonging outside Singapore for GST purposes, including those that are required to appoint local agents (i.e. section 33(1) agents) to handle their GST matters.\n\nThis includes Overseas Vendors that are registered for GST under the Overseas Vendor Registration (\u201cOVR\u201d) Pay-only regime and OVR full regime.\n\nRefers to businesses that are liable to register for GST solely by virtue of the imported services that they are making, and/or importation of Low-Value Goods (\u201cLVG\u201d) due to reverse charge (\u201cRC\u201d) rules. \n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, businesses that make some RC transactions but did not register for GST solely by virtue of the RC rules will not be classified as \u201cExcluded Businesses\u201d. Such businesses will need to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nPlease refer to Annex D for more details on determining whether your business qualifies as an Excluded Business.\n\nHow Invoice Data will be Transmitted to IRAS\n\nBroadly, there are four types of submissions for transmitting invoice data to IRAS:\n\nType of submission\n\nDescription\n\nType 1A Submission\n\nSupply transaction made by the supplier within the InvoiceNow network\n\nType 1B Submission\n\nCorresponding purchase transaction received by the customer within the InvoiceNow network from the supply transaction under Type 1A Submission above\n\nPeppol/Solution-extracted invoice submission method\n\nPeppol invoice\n\nSolution-extracted invoice\n\nType 2 Submission\n\nSupply transaction made outside the InvoiceNow network\n\nSolution-extracted invoice\n\nType 3 Submission\n\nPurchase transaction made outside the InvoiceNow network\n\nSolution-extracted invoice submission method\n\nSolution-extracted submission method\n\nSolution-extracted submission method\n\nType 1A and 1B Submissions: Supply Transaction and Corresponding Purchase Transaction made within InvoiceNow Network\n\nFor a supply transaction made within the InvoiceNow network (e.g., where both the GST-registered supplier and the customer are connected to IRAS via the InvoiceNow network), the transmission of the invoice data to IRAS occurs in the following manner:\n\nType 1A Submission: Supply Transaction made within InvoiceNow Network (i.e., Peppol Invoice)\n\n(a) GST-registered supplier issues a Peppol invoice for a supply transaction using its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution via the InvoiceNow network and sends the invoice to its Access Point.\n\nIRSPs that have built in validation checks on wrongful GST charges would detect invoices from suppliers that wrongly charge GST and trigger an alert to the sender (i.e. the supplier) for his attention. For more information on this, please refer to the \u201cValidation Checks\u201d section.\n\n(b) Supplier\u2019s AP forwards the invoice to the customer\u2019s Access Point.\n\n(c) Once the invoice data is successfully sent to the customer\u2019s Access Point, a copy of the Peppol invoice will be transmitted to IRAS automatically.\n\n(d) Customer\u2019s Access Point forwards the invoice to the customer.\n\nType 1B Submission: Corresponding Purchase Transaction received by the Customer within InvoiceNow Network from the Supply Transaction under Type 1A Submission (i.e., Solution-extracted Invoice)\n\n(e) GST-registered customer receives, validates and accepts the invoice in its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nThis would include indicating the appropriate GST Category Code(s) for purchases, the taxable purchase amount and input tax amount that the customer wishes to claim. The practice is in line with the typical process today when businesses record their purchases in their accounting systems.\n\n(f) A copy of the recorded purchase invoice is transmitted to IRAS by way of a Solution-extracted invoice through the customer\u2019s Access Point.\n\nType 2 Submission: Supply Transaction made outside InvoiceNow Network (i.e., Solution-extracted invoice)\n\nFor a supply transaction made outside the InvoiceNow network (e.g., where the customer is not on the InvoiceNow network, or where the transactions are made using point-of-sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) systems or to customers who are individuals), the transmission of the invoice data to IRAS occurs in the following manner:\n\n(a) GST-registered supplier issues a paper/PDF invoice for the supply transaction to the customer and records the transaction in its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nIRSPs that have built in the validation check on wrongful GST charges, which would help detect invoices from suppliers that wrongly charge GST and trigger an alert to the sender (which in this case is the supplier) for his attention.\n\n(b) A Solution-extracted invoice for the supply transaction is submitted to the supplier\u2019s Access Point.\n\n(c) Supplier\u2019s Access Point transmits the Solution-extracted invoice to IRAS.\n\nType 3 Submission: Purchase Transaction made outside InvoiceNow Network (i.e., Solution-extracted invoice)\n\nFor a purchase transaction made outside the InvoiceNow network (e.g., where the GST-registered supplier is not on the InvoiceNow network, or where the transaction(s) involve petty cash purchases (or PCPs), the transmission of the invoice data to IRAS occurs in the following manner:\n\n(a) The GST-registered customer receives a paper/PDF invoice for the purchase transaction and records the transaction in its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nIRSPs that have built in the validation check on wrongful GST charges, which would help detect invoices from suppliers that wrongly charge GST and trigger an alert to the sender (which in this case is the customer) for his attention.\n\nThe customer sends a Solution-extracted invoice for the purchase transaction to its Access Point.\n\nCustomer\u2019s Access Point transmits the Solution-extracted invoice to IRAS.\n\nTransmitting Credit Notes\n\nFrom time to time, suppliers may issue credit notes to their customers to adjust the taxable value and GST amount in the original invoices, for example, to correct mistakes in the original invoices or to adjust for sales discounts/rebates. Invoice data on such credit note transactions needs to be transmitted to IRAS as well.\n\nThe approach for transmitting credit notes would be the same as the approach for transmitting invoice data stated in paragraphs 6.2 to 6.4 above. More details on how to perform the submission of credit notes can be found in the \u201cInvoicing Guidance for Common GST Scenarios\u201d section test.\n\nScope of Invoice Data to Transmit\n\nTo simplify the data collection rules under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement, GST-registered businesses are required to transmit to IRAS invoice data that is reported in the GST return, other than specific excluded transactions (\u201cExcluded Transactions\u201d).\n\nIn general, such Excluded Transactions have no underlying supplies or purchases but are reported solely for GST purposes (e.g. deemed supplies), or the value and timing of invoice data to be submitted to IRAS are difficult to determine (in the case of supplies of financial services).\n\nWhat Businesses need to transmit under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement:\n\n+ All standard-rated supplies\n+ All zero-rated supplies\n+ All exempt supplies\n+ All standard-rated purchases\n+ All zero-rated purchases\n\u2013 Excluded Transactions\n\nPlease refer to the tables below for more details.\n\nInvoice Data Reported in the GST Return \u2013 Mandatory to Transmit to IRAS\n\nType Supplies/Purchases\n\nStandard-rated supplies\n\nExamples of Data to Transmit\n\nLocal sales of goods and services:\n\n\u2022 Supplies where GST is disregarded or suspended under certain GST schemes e.g., Approved Contract Manufacturer and Trader\n\nGST Category Codes\n\n\u2022 SR\n\u2022 NA\n\u2022 SRCA-S\n\u2022 SROVR-RS\n\u2022 SROVR-LVG\n\nZero-rated supplies\n\n\u2022 Export sales of goods\n\u2022 Provision of international services\n\u2022 Sale or lease of residential properties\n\u2022 Local sale of investment precious metals\n\n\u2022 ZR\n\u2022 ES33\n\u2022 ESN33\n\nStandard-rated purchases\n\n\u2022 Purchases with input tax claims, e.g. purchase of business inventories from GST-registered suppliers\n\u2022 Purchases where input tax is directly attributable to Regulation 33 exempt supplies and non-Regulation 33 exempt supplies\n\u2022 Purchases where input tax claims are residual in nature\n\u2022 Purchases under certain GST schemes e.g. GMS, AMFT and Approved 3rd Party Logistics Company (\u201cA3PL\u201d) scheme\n\u2022 Purchases where Customer Accounting is applied\n\n\u2022 TX\n\u2022 TX-ESS\n\u2022 TX-N33\n\u2022 TX-RE\n\u2022 TXNA\n\u2022 TXCA\n\nZero-rated purchases\n\n\u2022 Purchase of goods that are exported\n\u2022 Purchase of international services e.g. international freight charges, IDD calls\n\n\u2022 ZP\n\nExcluded Transactions \u2013 Excluded from Scope\n\nType of Supplies/Purchases\n\nTransactions to Exclude\n\nStandard-rated supplies\n\n\u2022 Deemed supplies (e.g. free goods)\n\u2022 Reverse charge supplies on which businesses are required to account GST\n\nZero-rated supplies\n\n\u2022 Goods exported without actual sales\n\u2022 All exempt financial services that qualify for zero-rating\n\u2022 All exempt digital payment tokens (\u201cDPT\u201d) that qualify for zero-rating\n\nExempt supplies\n\n\u2022 All exempt financial services\n\u2022 All exempt DPTs, such as:\n- Exchange of DPTs for fiat currency or other DPTs\n- Loan of DPTs\n\nStandard-rated purchases\n\n\u2022 Import permits for importation of goods\n\u2022 Reverse charge purchases on which businesses are entitled to input tax claims\n\u2022 Goods and services purchased by overseas headquarters (or overseas branches) of a Singapore branch\n\nInvoice Data Not Reported in the GST Return \u2013 Excluded from Scope\n\nType of Supplies/Purchases\n\nOut-of-scope supplies\n\nTransactions to Exclude\n\nAll out-of-scope supplies, such as:\n\n\u2022 Third country sales of goods\n\u2022 Services supplied by overseas headquarters or branches\n\nType of Supplies/Purchases\n\nTransactions to Exclude\n\nExcluded transactions for GST purpose, such as carbon credits, regulatory fees, transfer of business as a going concern\n\nNon-reportable purchases\n\nAll non-reportable purchases, such as:\n\n\u2022 Purchases from non-GST registered suppliers\n\u2022 Purchases where input tax is blocked e.g. motor car expenses\n\u2022 Purchases that are exempted from GST\n\u2022 Out-of-scope purchases from GST-registered suppliers\n\nList of GST Category Codes Accepted by IRAS\n\nA comprehensive list of GST category codes accepted by IRAS can be found in Annex E.\n\nThis standardised set of GST category codes is provided to enable businesses to classify their supply and purchase transactions. Businesses are encouraged to incorporate the standardised set of GST category codes into their InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions or systems and use it to tag their transactions for submission to IRAS.\n\nSome businesses may wish to continue to use their internal tax codes as per their current business processes. Such businesses will have to work with their IRSPs or APs to map their internal tax codes to the list of accepted GST category codes before submitting the invoice data to IRAS.\n\nSubmission of Invoice Data with Supplies that Fall Within and Outside the Scope\n\nIf the invoice or credit note has a line item that pertains to invoice data that falls within the scope of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement above, then the invoice data relating to the entire invoice or credit note must be transmitted to IRAS under the requirement.\n\nExample 4\n\nCompany D issues a tax invoice to its tenant for the following:\n\n\u2022 A one-month refundable security deposit\n\u2022 Lease rental for Apr to Jun 2026\n\nIt charges and accounts GST solely on the lease rental. The refundable security deposit is outside the scope of GST.\n\nAs the invoice contains a standard-rated supply, which is within the scope, Company D is required to transmit the entire invoice data to IRAS.\n\nOption to Transmit All Supplies and Purchases Invoice Data\n\nBusinesses may opt to transmit invoice data on transactions that fall outside the scope of the requirement if doing so eases their compliance burden. For instance, businesses may opt to transmit to IRAS invoice data relating to all transactions, including out-of-scope supply transactions, rather than to exclude the latter. Businesses will need to work with IRSPs (if applicable) and APs to enable this.\n\nSubmission of Purchase Invoice Data where Input Tax is not Claimed in Full\n\nIf the businesses incur any purchases with input tax for both business and non-business purposes, they should submit the purchase invoice data for the claimable portion only. Businesses can do this by applying the relevant GST category code for the claimable portion for submission to IRAS. Alternatively, businesses may choose to submit the entire invoice for ease of compliance. The businesses should adopt its chosen approach for its invoice data submissions consistently.\n\nExample 5\n\nCompany E incurs mobile phone expenses amounting to S$7,000 (before GST), and GST of S$630. As the mobile phone expenses are incurred for both business and personal calls, Company E wishes to apply a proxy of 4/7 to apportion the portion of the expense as incurred for business purpose.\n\nAssuming the general input tax claiming conditions are met, strictly speaking, Company E should apply the GST category code TX and submit S$4,000 as the value of standard-rated purchases and S$360 as the amount of input tax to IRAS as its purchase invoice data under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nAlternatively, Company E may choose to submit S$7,000 as the value of standard-rated purchases and S$630 as the amount of input tax even if Company E only claims 4/7 of the mobile phone expenses, if doing so eases compliance. However, Company E must apply the same approach consistently for all its input tax that is not claimed in full.\n\nOption to Submit Invoice Data on an Aggregated Basis\n\nBusinesses may not be able to submit certain invoice data at a transactional level. They are thus allowed to aggregate their transactions before transmitting to IRAS for the following scenarios:\n\n(a) Supplies made via point-of-sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) systems e.g. cash registers;\n\n(b) Supplies where simplified tax invoices (\u201cSTI\u201d) are issued. Serially numbered receipts are considered as STI transactions; or\n\n(c) Petty cash purchases (\u201cPCP\u201d) e.g. staff claims and purchases using corporate cards.\n\nOnly POS, STI and PCP transactions can be submitted to IRAS on an aggregated basis. Businesses are not allowed to aggregate any other transactions for submissions to IRAS.\n\nAggregated invoice data will be sent to IRAS in the form of solution-extracted invoices.\n\nExample 6\n\nCompany F is a retail store which issues serially printed receipts via its POS system to its customers. As the customers are not on InvoiceNow network, the receipts are not issued via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nTo transmit the invoice data on the supplies made to IRAS, Company F may aggregate the daily POS sales and record the information into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution as one single solution-extracted invoice for transmission to IRAS at a regular interval and before the submission due date.\n\nAs the invoice is submitted on an aggregated basis, certain mandatory data elements (\u201cMDEs\u201d) may be defaulted to \u201cPOS\u201d.\n\nExample 7\n\nCompany G adopts an employee expense system where staff claims are processed into its accounting system on a weekly basis.\n\nTo transmit the invoice data on the purchases to IRAS, Company G may aggregate the employee expenses and record the information into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution as a single solution-extracted invoice for transmission to IRAS at a regular interval (weekly in Company G\u2019s case) and before the submission due date.\n\nFor more details on how to complete the Mandatory Data Elements (\u201cMDEs\u201d) for the submission of aggregated invoice data, refer to the relevant examples at Annex A (for supplies invoice data submissions) and Annex C (for purchases invoice data submissions) respectively.\n\nBulk Submission of Invoice Data\n\nBusinesses will be able to perform bulk submissions of invoice data to IRAS via API. Each bulk submission data package can contain a maximum of 10 documents of the same invoice type (e.g. up to 10 invoices or 10 credit notes) and each data package should not be more than 10 MB in total data size.\n\nBusinesses may speak to their AP and/or IRSP to find out more on how they can perform bulk submissions.\n\nDue Date for Transmitting Invoice Data\n\nThe supplies or purchase invoice data must be transmitted to IRAS by the earlier of:\n\n(a) The date on which the relevant GST return is filed; or\n\n(b) The filing due date of the relevant GST return.\n\nThe \u201crelevant GST return\u201d refers to the GST return covering the prescribed accounting period when the date of the transaction occurs.\n\nThe date of the transaction is determined as follows:\n\nTypes of Transaction\n\nDate of Transaction\n\nSupplies data\n\nFor a supply where an invoice is or to be issued, the date of transaction would be the issuance date of the document; and\n\nFor all other supplies, the date of transaction would be the date the transaction is posted into the accounting system.\n\nPurchases data\n\nFor a purchase where the supplier\u2019s invoice or an equivalent document is to be issued, the date of transaction would either be the:\n\n(a) Issuance date of the document; or\n\n(b) Date the transaction is posted into the accounting system.\n\nFor all other purchases, the date of transaction would be the date the transaction is posted into the accounting system.\n\nIRAS recommends that data extraction be carried out regularly (e.g. daily or weekly).\n\nExample 8\n\nCompany H issues a tax invoice to its customer on 20 Mar 2026 and files the GST return for prescribed accounting period 1 Jan to 31 Mar 2026 on 20 Apr 2026.\n\nAs the date of transaction is based on invoice date, the transaction falls within the prescribed accounting period 1 Jan to 31 Mar 2026. Company H must submit the invoice data relating to the supply of goods to the customer by 20 Apr 2026, which is the earlier of the filing date (20 Apr 2026) or filing due date (30 Apr 2026).\n\nExample 9\n\nCompany J receives a tax invoice dated 20 Mar 2026 and files GST return for the prescribed accounting period 1 Jan to 31 Mar 2026 on 15 May 2026. Company J is late in filing as the filing due date is 30 Apr 2026.\n\nAs the date of transaction is based on invoice date, the transaction falls within the prescribed accounting period 1 Jan to 31 Mar 2026. Company J must submit the invoice data relating to this purchase by 30 Apr 2026, which is the earlier of the filing date (15 May 2026) or filing due date (30 Apr 2026).\n\nAdvance Payments\n\nBusinesses may receive advance payments from their customers, before tax invoices are issued.\n\nThe business does not need to create a separate invoice to submit the invoice data at the time the advance payment is received. It may submit the invoice data to IRAS subsequently when the invoice is issued to the customer.\n\nExample 10\n\nCompany K issues a pro-forma invoice to Company L for the collection of advance payment. Company K will only issue the tax invoice when the goods are ready for delivery to Company L.\n\nAs the pro-forma invoice is not considered a bill of payment, Company K is not required to submit the invoice data when it issues the pro-forma invoice or receives the advance payment from Company L. Company K will submit the invoice data to IRAS only when it issues the tax invoice.\n\nSubmission of Invoice Data before the Business is GST-registered, i.e. Pre-registration GST claims\n\nBusinesses are required to submit invoice data for transactions that fall on and after the date the business become GST-registered.\n\nAs such, businesses are not required to submit invoice data for pre-registration GST claims on purchases. Nonetheless, businesses are required to maintain proper records and documentary evidence to support their pre-registration claims.\n\nExample 11\n\nCompany M is GST-registered with effect from 1 Jun 2026. It has received tax invoices with GST charged and has made payment for them prior to its GST registration. It will claim these pre-registration GST claims in its first GST return for the prescribed accounting period 1 Apr to 30 Jun 2026.\n\nNotwithstanding that Company M will be making the pre-registration GST claims in its GST return, Company M is not required to submit the invoice data relating to pre-registration GST claims under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nSubmission of Invoice Data after the Business Ceased to be GST-registered\n\nBusinesses are required to submit invoice data for transactions up to the last day of their GST-registration. Supplies made by a business that has cancelled its GST registration may straddle its GST de-registration date. For example, the business may supply a service or deliver goods before its de-registration date but issues an invoice and receives payment for that service only after it has de-registered from GST. While the business must account for the output tax on the supply in its final GST F8 return, the business is not required to submit the invoice data relating to this supply to IRAS, if the invoice is issued after the business has ceased to be GST-registered. Nonetheless, the businesses are required to maintain proper records and documentary evidence to support their supplies and purchases straddling their GST de-registration date.\n\nExample 12\n\nCompany N sells and delivers goods worth S$10,000 on 20 Jun 2027 before it was de-registered from GST on 1 Jul 2027. The final GST F8 return covers the prescribed accounting period 1 Apr to 30 Jun 2027.\n\nAs the invoice was issued after Company N ceased to be GST-registered, Company N is not required to submit the invoice data to IRAS.\n\nBusinesses may also receive invoices that are dated after their GST de-registration date, for supplies of services performed or goods delivered/made available before their GST de-registration date.\n\nThe business is not required to submit the invoice data relating to this purchase, if the invoice date falls outside the business\u2019s GST registration period.\n\nExample 13\n\nCompany O receives a supplier\u2019s tax invoice dated 5 Jul 2027 for services rendered on 20 Jun 2027. Company O was de-registered from GST with effect from 1 Jul 2027 and the final GST F8 return covers the prescribed accounting period 1 Apr to 30 Jun 2027.\n\nAs the invoice is dated after Company O has ceased to be GST-registered, Company O is not required to submit the invoice data to IRAS.\n\nMandatory Data Elements\n\nIRAS has identified a set of essential data elements that must be present in the invoice data sent to IRAS. This set of data elements is in line with the existing GST content requirements of a tax invoice and other invoices set out by the Comptroller under Regulations 11 and 13 of the GST (General) Regulations of the GST Act and facilitates the use of the invoice data for tax administration purposes.\n\nWhen transmitting invoice data to IRAS, the supplies and purchase invoices and credit notes must contain the following mandatory data elements (\u201cMDEs\u201d):\n\nMDEs present in both Invoice and Credit Note\n\nSupplier Details\n\nSupplier Endpoint ID\n\nSupplier Scheme ID\n\nSupplier ID\n\nSupplier GSTN\n\nSupplier Tax Scheme ID\n\nCustomer Details\n\nSupplier Name\n\nSupplier Address \u2013 Address Line 1\n\nSupplier Address \u2013 Postal Code\n\nSupplier Address \u2013 Country Code\n\nCustomer Endpoint ID\n\nCustomer Scheme ID\n\nCustomer ID\n\nCustomer Name\n\nCustomer Address \u2013 Address Line 1\n\nCustomer Address \u2013 Postal Code\n\nCustomer Address \u2013 Country Code\n\nMDEs present in Invoice\n\nCustomization ID\n\nInvoice Line Identifier\n\nProfile ID\n\nItem Name\n\nDoc UUID\n\nUnit\n\nInvoice Number\n\nQuantity\n\nItem Net Price\n\nInvoice Issue Date\n\nInvoice Type Code (i.e., invoice or credit note)\n\nItem GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nInvoice Line Net Amount\n\nSum of Invoice Line Net Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Taxable Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nSubtotal GST Category Rate\n\nTotal GST Amount\n\nTotal Invoice Amount without GST\n\nTotal Invoice Amount with GST\n\nItem GST Category Code\n\nSubtotal GST Category Code\n\nAmount due for Payment\n\nInvoice Currency Code\n\nItem GST Category Rate\n\nMDEs present in Credit Note\n\nCustomization ID\n\nUnit\n\nProfile ID\n\nQuantity\n\nDoc UUID\n\nCredit Note Number\n\nCredit Note Currency Code\n\nCredit Note Date\n\nItem Net Price\n\nTotal Credit Note Amount without GST\n\nTotal Credit Note Amount with GST\n\nAmount due for Payment\n\nInvoice Type Code (i.e., invoice or credit note)\n\nItem Name\n\nItem GST Category Code\n\nSubtotal GST Category Code\n\nInvoice Note\n\nItem GST Category Rate\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nTo enable businesses to better understand how the MDEs are to be filled for the different types of invoice data to be transmitted, we have provided examples for common invoicing scenarios in the Annexes for reference:\n\nSupplies Transactions (Refer to Annex A)\n\n(a) Peppol invoices (under Type 1A Submission)\n\n(b) Solution-extracted invoices (under Type 2 Submission)\n\n(c) Aggregated POS or STI transactions (under Type 2 Submission)\n\nPurchase Transactions (Refer to Annex B)\n\n(d) Solution-extracted invoices (under Type 1B or Type 2 Submission)\n\n(e) Aggregated PCP transactions (under Type 2 Submission)\n\nCredit Notes (Refer to Annex C)\n\n(f) Credit notes issued by business (under Type 1A or Type 2 Submission)\n\n(g) Credit notes received by business (under Type 1B or Type 3 Submission)\n\nCustomer\u2019s UEN Information\n\nBusinesses would need to collect their customer\u2019s information, e.g. Customer UEN (i.e. customer\u2019s business registration number), Customer Name and Customer Address, which are mandatory data elements for submission to IRAS. If the customers are individuals, businesses can indicate \u201cNA\u201d in both the Customer Name and Customer UEN fields. When indicating the details of overseas customers, businesses must indicate the customer\u2019s overseas business registration number. Businesses must maintain supporting documents to substantiate the customer information as part of their recording keeping.\n\nPeppol Invoices Issued Without the Words \u201cTax Invoice\u201d\n\nAlthough Peppol invoices issued by the supplier (under Type 1A Submission) and received by the customer (under Type 1B Submission) under the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution do not contain the words \u201cTax Invoice\u201d, IRAS is prepared to accept the invoices as valid tax invoices which businesses may use to support their GST input tax claims. This is on the condition that all the other contents required on a tax invoice, as specified under Regulation 11 of the GST (General) Regulations are present. Any input tax claims by the business will also be subject to the normal input tax claiming conditions for GST.\n\nOn the other hand, for all other invoice data submitted to IRAS (i.e. under Type 2 and 3 Submission), the underlying invoices issued and received remain as the source document. In this regard, the words \u201cTax Invoice\u201d must be shown on the underlying invoices in order for the supplier to fulfil Regulation 11 of the GST (General) Regulations, and for the customer to fulfil the normal input tax claiming conditions. When transmitting such solution-extracted invoices to IRAS, businesses need not indicate the words \u201cTax Invoice\u201d on the invoices.\n\nValidation Checks\n\nData Schema Validation Check\n\nIRSPs and GST-registered businesses submitting invoice data to IRAS must implement a data schema validation check to ensure that the data entered is compliant with the mandatory data elements. Schematron files are available for IRSPs and GST-registered businesses to use to validate their invoice data submissions and ensure they conform with the regular XML structure.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, IRAS has not imposed any validation check between the invoice level amounts and the line level amounts on invoices. This is because solutions used by businesses may handle rounding differences on invoices differently. For example, some solutions may round the amounts at the line level, while others may round the amounts at the invoice level.\n\nPlease speak to your IRSPs or APs or your in-house enterprise solution providers to facilitate the development of your solution.\n\nValidation Check on Wrongful GST Charges\n\nIRSPs and GST-registered businesses are recommended to build the validation check on wrongful GST charges feature in their InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. This check utilises invoice data such as the Supplier GSTN, Invoice Date and GST Amount and data returned from the IRAS\u2019 Check GST Register API to detect invoices that wrongly charge GST.\n\nImplementing this validation check will ease tax compliance, and give businesses the assurance that the GST charges are legitimate. For more information, please speak to your AP or IRSP to find out how they can support you in this work.\n\nInvoicing Guidance for Common GST Scenarios\n\nIssuing Credit Notes\n\nA GST-registered business may issue a credit note to adjust the taxable value and GST amount in the original invoices previously issued and submitted to IRAS (e.g. over-billings, incorrectly zero-rated a transaction that cannot qualify for zero-rating). Invoice data relating to credit notes is to be sent to IRAS under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nExample 14\n\nCompany P makes a local supply of customised tools and heavy machinery to Company Q. As Company Q is not on the InvoiceNow network, Company P issues a sales invoice in PDF to Company Q and submits the supply invoice data to IRAS under Type 2 submission.\n\nSubsequently, Company Q returned the customised tools to Company P due to poor workmanship, and Company P agreed to provide a full refund.\n\nAs the monetary value of the supply has changed, Company P must issue a credit note to Company Q, and submit the credit note data to IRAS under Type 2 submission.\n\nIn the case of adjustment to a standard-rated supply, if both the supplier and customer choose not to adjust the GST amount charged on the original invoices in the credit note and fulfil the conditions for doing so, the supplier may do so and submit the credit note data to IRAS accordingly. The supplier should continue to apply GST Category Code \u201cSR\u201d, even if the GST amounts are not adjusted.\n\nIf the supplier wishes to cancel an invoice, the business may issue a credit note to do so. To cancel the invoice, the amounts and GST category codes on the credit note would need to tally with the MDEs of the original invoice.\n\nWhen issuing or recording the credit note, the business must ensure that all the required MDEs of a credit note are filled. The business should, where possible, indicate the number and date of the original invoice in the following MDE fields Preceding Invoice Number (IBT-025) and Preceding Invoice Date (IBT-026) when submitting credit note data to IRAS. If the business is unable to identify the original invoice, these fields may be left blank. However, it must maintain documentary evidence that it has accounted for GST on the original supply.\n\nReceiving Credit Notes\n\nBesides issuing credit notes, a GST-registered business may, in the course of business, receive credit notes from its supplier as well. The business will need to receive, validate and accept the invoice in its solution. This would include indicating the appropriate purchase GST category code(s), taxable purchase amount and input tax amount that the customer wishes to claim.\n\nPlease refer to Annex C for illustrations on how the data elements are to be populated for credit notes issued or received for submission to IRAS.\n\nMaking Resubmissions to IRAS\n\nAfter the invoice has been issued and submitted to IRAS, a GST-registered business may at times need to perform adjustments that do not affect the monetary values on the invoice (e.g. updating the Invoice Note, change in GST category code from ZR to ES33 etc.) recorded in its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. For such transactions, the business will have to send the revised invoice to IRAS using the same Document UUID contained in the original invoice, which is part of the functionality within InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions. Please speak to your IRSP or AP on how the resubmission process works within your InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nIRAS will regard the last invoice or credit note submitted by the business to be the latest submission and use that record for tax administration purposes.\n\nWhere the adjustments are made via the issuance of a credit note, such adjustments would not constitute a resubmission.\n\nExample 16\n\nCompany T makes a local supply to Company U. As both companies are on the InvoiceNow network, Company T issues an invoice to Company U through the InvoiceNow network and submits the supply invoice data to IRAS under Type 1A submission.\n\nSubsequently, Company U notices that the goods delivery address indicated on the invoice is incorrect, and requests Company T to revise and resend the invoice to Company U.\n\nAs there is no change to the monetary value of the supply, Company T may amend and send the revised invoice (using the Document UUID of the original invoice) to Company U through the InvoiceNow network. Company T may do so by performing a resubmission of the supply invoice data to IRAS under Type 1A submission.\n\nIf Company U has not processed and submitted the incorrect invoice as purchase invoice data to IRAS under Type 1B submission, Company U may simply submit the revised invoice as purchase invoice data to IRAS under Type 1B submission. Otherwise, Company U may need to resubmit both the original invoice and the revised invoice as purchase invoice data to IRAS under Type 1B submission.\n\nErrors made in Processing Solution-extracted Invoices\n\nWhere there are errors in the solution-extracted invoices processed after the data has been submitted to IRAS (e.g. typographical errors in the invoice value), businesses will have to send the revised invoice to IRAS using the same Document UUID contained in the original invoice.\n\nExample 17\n\nWhen processing an invoice from a supplier, Company V wrongly entered and submitted a purchase invoice data of S$100 to IRAS.\n\nTo rectify this mistake, Company V amends the GST amount of the supplier\u2019s invoice that was previously recorded in the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. As amendment is made to the invoice data submitted to IRAS previously, Company V needs to resubmit the invoice data to IRAS using the same Document UUID of the original invoice.\n\nExample 18\n\nCompany W incorrectly keyed in the GST category code of \u201cTX\u201d instead of \u201cZP\u201d when processing a zero-rated purchase invoice and submitted the invoice data to IRAS.\n\nTo rectify this mistake, Company W amends the GST category code of the zero-rated purchase invoice recorded in the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nAs the amendment is made to the invoice data submitted to IRAS previously, Company W needs to resubmit the invoice data to IRAS using the same Document UUID of the original invoice.\n\nIssuing Invoices in Foreign Currency\n\nA GST-registered business may issue invoices denominated in foreign currency. When doing so, certain non-mandatory data elements such as Tax currency code, Invoice total without GST in tax currency (SGD), Invoice total with GST in tax currency (SGD), Total GST amount in tax currency (SGD) should also be filled in.\n\nExample 19\n\nCompany X makes a local sale of goods to an overseas company amounting to US$1,000 (or S$1,350), with GST charged.\n\nIn the supplies invoice data to be submitted to IRAS, Company X should indicate the following:\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission) or Solution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nIBT-005\n\nInvoice Currency Code\n\nUSD\n\nSGD\n\nIBT-006\n\nTax Currency Code\n\nSGD\n\nIBT-109\n\nTotal Amount without GST (USD)\n\n1,000.00\n\nIBT-110\n\nTotal GST Amount in invoice currency (USD)\n\n90.00\n\nIBT-112\n\nTotal Amount with GST (USD)\n\n1,090.00\n\nCurrency ID for Total Amount with GST\n\nSGD\n\nIBT-111\n\nTotal Amount without GST in tax currency (SGD)\n\n1,350.00\n\nIBT-111\n\nTotal GST amount in tax currency (SGD)\n\n121.50\n\nCurrency ID for Total GST Amount\n\nSGD\n\nThe business does not need to provide the exchange rate in the invoice but it must use the approved exchange rates specified in the e-Tax Guide \u201cExchange Rates for GST Purpose\u201d to convert the foreign currency to SGD.\n\nInvoice Submissions with Multiple Line Items involving a mix of Taxable and Non-Taxable Transactions\n\nA GST-registered business may at times issue invoices with multiple line items with different GST treatments and GST category codes. Such invoice data may be submitted to IRAS as a single invoice.\n\nExample 20\n\nCompany Y makes the following sales of goods to the customer:\n\nDescription\n\n5 hats, delivered locally\n8 shirts, delivered locally\n10 pairs of shoes, exported from Singapore to overseas\n\nGST category code\n\nSR\nSR\nZR\n\nTotal value of goods (before GST, if applicable)\n\nS$100\nS$200\nS$400\n\nCompany Y may issue and submit the supply invoice data as a single tax invoice to IRAS.\n\nIn the supply invoice data submission, Company Y may indicate the following information accordingly at the line-item, subtotal and total levels:\n\nAt the line-item level\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission) or Solution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nIBT-126\n\nInvoice Line Identifier\n\nIBT-129\n\nQuantity\n\nIBT-130\n\nUnit\n\nInvoice Line Net Amount\n\nCurrency ID for Invoice Line Net Amount\n\nItem Name\n\nItem GST Category Code\n\nItem GST Category Rate\n\nItem GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nItem Net Price\n\nFor the hats\n\n1\n5\nPC\n100.00\nSGD\n\nFor the shirts\n\n2\n8\nPC\n200.00\nSGD\n\nFor the shoes\n\n3\n10\nPC\n400.00\nSGD\n\nAt the subtotal level\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission) or Solution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nIBT-116\n\nSubtotal GST Category Taxable Amount\n\nCurrency ID for Subtotal GST Category Taxable Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Amount\n\nCurrency ID for Subtotal GST Category Tax Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Code\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nSubtotal GST Category Rate\n\nFor all standard-rated supplies\n\n300.00\nSGD\n\n27.00\nSGD\n\nSR\nGST\n9\n\nFor all zero-rated supplies\n\n400.00\nSGD\n\n0.00\nSGD\n\nZR\nGST\n0\n\nAt the total level\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission) or Solution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nIBT-109\n\nTotal Amount without GST\n\nCurrency ID for Invoice Total Amount without GST\n\nTotal GST Amount\n\nCurrency ID for Total GST Amount\n\nTotal Amount with GST\n\nCurrency ID for Total Amount with GST\n\nAmount due for payment\n\nCurrency ID for Amount due for payment\n\n700.00\nSGD\n\n27.00\nSGD\n\n727.00\nSGD\n\n727.00\nSGD\n\nGST Invoicing Requirements for Different Groups of Businesses\n\nThe table below provides guidance on how different groups of GST-registered businesses should complete the Sender ID, Supplier ID and Supplier GSTN fields when issuing invoices.\n\nScenarios\n\nGST invoicing requirements\n\nGuidance to fill in the invoice/credit note MDEs\n\nEntity is a company\n\nThe company should reflect its GSTN on invoices that it issues to charge and account for GST on taxable supplies that it makes.\n\n\u2022 Sender ID (from SBDH envelope): To use the Peppol ID registered under the UEN of the company.\n\n\u2022 Supplier ID (IBT-030): To indicate the UEN of the company.

However, IRAS recognises that legitimate differences could arise due to reasons such as:\n\n(a) Timing differences \u2013 e.g. where time of supplied is triggered by payment, and invoices are issued after the filing of GST return; supplies straddling GST registration, etc.\n\n(b) Supplies where invoices are not required \u2013 e.g. deemed supplies and Reverse Charge\n\n(c) Purchases where input tax are not claimed or not claimed in full, e.g. input tax subject to attribution or apportionment\n\n(d) Correcting errors in F5 instead of filing F7\n\nBusinesses will not be penalised so long as they adhere to the record keeping requirements and are able to produce these records upon request to substantiate their GST reporting and invoice data submissions.\n\nImplications to GST Group Registration\n\nA new voluntary GST registrant may apply to be included into an existing GST group. If the new voluntary GST-registered entity is included into an existing GST group once it is GST-registered, the entire GST group will be subjected to the GST InvoiceNow Requirement at a later phase, to be announced in future.\n\nExample 23\n\nOn 1 Apr 2026, Company DD intends to apply for voluntary GST registration and to join its parent company under an existing GST group registration.\n\nIn this case, Company DD will be subject to GST InvoiceNow Requirement at a later phase, based on the timeline for the entire GST group, which will be announced in the future.\n\nWhen sending invoice data to IRAS, the GST group can either transmit invoice data separately (as individual members of the group), or on a consolidated basis (by the representative member of the GST group).\n\nThere could be instances where a GST group consists of an Excluded Business as a group member. In such cases, the invoice data of the Excluded Business need not be transmitted to IRAS under the requirement. The GST group may also choose to submit all invoice data to IRAS, including invoice data belonging to the Excluded Business, if doing so eases their compliance burden.\n\nEven if the invoice data is transmitted by each individual member, there is no change to the GST reporting requirement for entities under the GST group, i.e. the GST group will continue to report their GST return on a consolidated basis.\n\nImplications to Partially Exempt Businesses\n\nLike any other GST-registered businesses, partially exempt businesses are required to submit invoice data on purchases with input tax claims to IRAS.\n\nHowever, partially exempt businesses that fail the De Minimis rule are required to perform input tax attribution and apportionment, and they may satisfy the De Minimis Rule in some accounting periods and not in others. As such, these businesses may only be able to determine the actual input tax that are claimable at the end of each accounting period and tax year for longer period adjustments (where applicable).\n\nTo ease compliance, such partially exempt businesses may opt to submit all their purchase invoice data as part of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement, whether or not the input tax is claimed (partially or in full) and reported in the GST return. The businesses are not required to make any retrospective adjustments to the purchase invoice data at the end of the accounting period (or for longer period adjustments) based on the actual input tax claims submitted in the GST return.\n\nAPI Service Interruption\n\nIn the event that there is an API service interruption (e.g. when API call is interrupted in-transit, or when you receive no response or experience unexpected error while processing the submission), the InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions are designed with an exponential backoff retry approach to automatically perform the submission retries. Businesses may approach their APs or IRSPs for more information about the exponential backoff retry approach.\n\nIf businesses are not able to make the submission after performing several rounds of retries, they will have to submit their invoice data when the API service resumes. Businesses will be given sufficient time to make the submission.\n\nDuring the API service interruption, businesses can continue to transact with their customers and suppliers via the InvoiceNow network or outside the network, as this process is independent from the submission process to IRAS.\n\nBusinesses are also encouraged to put in place sufficient measures in their business continuity plans to cater for any unforeseen circumstances and activate them accordingly when the need arises.\n\nPreparing Early to Adopt GST InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions\n\nBusinesses are encouraged to come onboard early and plan ahead for the adoption of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions or make changes to their in-house enterprise solutions to be compatible with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement by taking the steps listed below.\n\nBetween Now to Apr 2025:\n\nStep 1: Ensure that your solution is InvoiceNow-Ready\n\nBusinesses with existing accounting or finance solutions, or businesses that are planning to purchase one, can check whether their preferred solution is listed on IMDA\u2019s accredited InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Providers (\u201cIRSPs\u201d) list. They may also consider adopting free solutions with basic InvoiceNow capabilities.\n\nLarge enterprises using their own in-house solutions may get in touch with an IMDA-accredited Access Point Provider to get connected to the InvoiceNow network.\n\nStep 2: Register for InvoiceNow and obtain a Peppol ID\n\nBusinesses may approach their IRSP or AP to register themselves in the SG Peppol Directory with their UEN and obtain a Peppol ID.\n\nFrom May 2025 onwards:\n\nStep 3: Ensure that your business can transmit invoice data successfully to IRAS\n\nBusinesses may enable the GST InvoiceNow Submission feature and test their system.\n\nTypes of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions\n\nOff-the-shelf accounting and finance solutions that are integrated with InvoiceNow capabilities to ensure that the business can successfully transmit invoices directly from its InvoiceNow-Ready solution to IRAS.\n\nContact the IRSP if you need assistance on how to do so.\n\nIn-house enterprise solutions\n\nContact the AP to ensure that the solution is connected to IRAS via API and that the GST InvoiceNow Submission feature is enabled.\n\nTest the invoice data transmission to IRAS with the AP, ensuring that the business receives transaction reports from the AP notifying if the invoice data submission is successful.\n\nBusinesses should allow 3 to 12 months for system connection and testing.\n\nContact Information\n\nFor enquiries on this e-Tax Guide, please contact the Goods and Service Tax Division at www.iras.gov.sg (select \u201cContact Us\u201d).\n\nAnnex A \u2013 Sample Examples of Supplies Invoice Submissions\n\nFor detailed explanation on the MDEs, you may refer to Invoice Data Submission API Interface Specs on the GST InvoiceNow Requirement available at APEX portal. We strongly advise you to reach out to your AP and/or IRSP. You may work with your AP or IRSP to auto-populate the values for applicable MDEs.\n\nNotes:\n\n\u2022 For submission of aggregated invoice data for supplies (i.e. aggregated POS or STI transactions), businesses are to indicate \u201cPOS\u201d or \u201cSTI\u201d (as the case may be) for certain MDEs when recording the aggregated invoice data in the InvoiceNow solution for the transmission to IRAS.\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission)\n\nSolution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nAggregated POS or STI transactions (Type 2 submission)\n\nIBT-024\n\nCustomization ID\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#conformant# urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:international:sg:3.0\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#conformant# urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:LocalTaxInvoice:sg:1.0\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#conformant# urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:LocalTaxInvoice:sg:1.0\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:pint:billing-1@sg-1\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:pint:billing-1@sg-1:LocalTaxInvoice:sg:1.0\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:pint:billing-1@sg-1:LocalTaxInvoice:sg:1.0\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\nIBT-023\n\nProfile ID\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:01:1.0\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:01:1.0\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:01:1.0\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:bis:billing\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:bis:billing\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:bis:billing\n\nIBT-001\n\nInvoice Number\n\nINV001\n\nINV001\n\nINV001\n\nBT-SG-003\n\nDoc UUID\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\nbfeac3d0-82d8-4195-9d88-53b3547f83a3\n\nbfeac3d0-82d8-4195-9d88-53b3547f83a3\n\nIBT-002\n\nInvoice Issue Date\n\n2024-11-30\n\n2024-11-30\n\n2024-11-30\n\nIBT-003\n\nInvoice Type Code\n\nIBT-005\n\nInvoice Currency Code\n\n380\n\nSGD\n\n",
        "summary": "The article outlines the new GST InvoiceNow Requirement for GST-registered businesses in Singapore, mandating the use of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to transmit invoice data directly to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). This initiative aims to streamline tax administration and align with global e-invoicing trends.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Implementation Timeline**:\n   - **Soft Launch**: Begins on May 1, 2025, allowing early adoption for existing GST-registered businesses.\n   - **Mandatory Adoption**:\n     - From November 1, 2025, for newly incorporated companies applying for voluntary GST registration.\n     - From April 1, 2026, for all new voluntary GST registrants.\n\n2. **Scope of Requirement**:\n   - Businesses must transmit invoice data for all GST supplies and purchases using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions via the InvoiceNow network.\n   - This includes various documents such as sales invoices, tax invoices, debit notes, and credit notes.\n\n3. **Excluded Businesses**:\n   - Certain entities, such as overseas businesses and those registering solely due to the Reverse Charge regime, are exempt from this requirement.\n\n4. **Types of Submissions**:\n   - **Type 1A**: Supply transactions made within the InvoiceNow network.\n   - **Type 1B**: Corresponding purchase transactions received within the network.\n   - **Type 2**: Supply and purchase transactions made outside the network.\n\n5. **Mandatory Data Elements (MDEs)**:\n   - Specific data must be included in submissions, such as supplier and customer details, invoice numbers, amounts, and GST category codes.\n\n6. **Benefits of Adoption**:\n   - Enhanced compliance with reduced manual processes, improved cash flow management, and potential for fewer audits due to better risk analysis by IRAS.\n\n7. **Preparation Steps**:\n   - Businesses should ensure their accounting solutions are InvoiceNow-Ready, register for a Peppol ID, and test their systems for successful data transmission to IRAS.\n\n8. **Data Transmission**:\n   - Invoice data must be submitted by the earlier of the GST return filing date or the due date of the return.\n\n9. **Validation Checks**:\n   - Businesses are encouraged to implement validation checks to prevent wrongful GST charges.\n\n10. **Future Developments**:\n    - Plans to extend mandatory participation to all GST-registered businesses will be announced based on industry feedback.\n\nThis requirement is part of Singapore's broader effort to digitalize tax processes and enhance compliance efficiency for GST-registered businesses.",

        "text": "{'content': 'The Advance Ruling System for Income Tax allows taxpayers to clarify the tax implications of their proposed transactions. Its purpose is to provide certainty on the tax treatment of these transactions. Any taxpayer liable to pay income tax in Singapore can apply for an advance ruling by submitting an application form and relevant documents. There is a fee for applying, which varies based on the complexity of the case. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) will issue a written ruling within a specified timeframe after receiving the application. An advance ruling is binding on both the IRAS and the taxpayer, as long as the facts and circumstances remain unchanged. However, there are limitations on the types of transactions that can be ruled upon. For more information, taxpayers can contact the IRAS directly or visit their official website. An advance ruling is a written interpretation of the Income Tax Act 1947 regarding how certain issues from a proposed arrangement will be treated for tax purposes. A ruling request must involve issues requiring interpretation of the law, not just inquiries about what the law clearly states. Under the advance ruling system, various entities, including companies and individuals, can apply for a ruling. The application process involves submitting a detailed request, and IRAS may decline to rule under certain circumstances, such as if the matter involves foreign law interpretation or if the application is deemed frivolous. If a ruling is issued, it is final, and taxpayers cannot appeal against it. They must declare in their annual Income Tax Return if they choose not to rely on the ruling. IRAS may publish summaries of rulings to enhance transparency and understanding of tax laws. Taxpayers can withdraw their application before the ruling is issued, but fees may apply if the withdrawal occurs after acceptance of the ruling terms.

The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) will issue a written ruling within a specified timeframe, which is binding on both the IRAS and the taxpayer as long as the circumstances remain unchanged.\n\nHowever, not all transactions are eligible for rulings; requests must involve issues requiring legal interpretation rather than straightforward inquiries. Various entities, including individuals and companies, can apply, but IRAS may decline requests under certain conditions, such as matters involving foreign law or frivolous applications. Rulings are final and cannot be appealed, and taxpayers must indicate on their annual Income Tax Return if they choose not to rely on the ruling. Taxpayers can withdraw their application before the ruling is issued, but fees may apply if withdrawal occurs after acceptance of the ruling terms. IRAS may also publish summaries of rulings to improve transparency, and Singapore engages in the exchange of information regarding rulings with certain jurisdictions.",

The Corporate Income Tax Return (Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C) must be completed in S$. If your company prepares its financial statements and tax computation in non-S$ functional currencies, you are required to translate the relevant non-S$ items into S$ equivalent amounts using the average rate for purposes of completing the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C. The total amount allowed on qualifying renovation and refurbishment works incurred should not exceed S$300,000 for every 3 consecutive years. Similarly, the total amount allowed on qualifying PIC expenditure incurred should not exceed the combined expenditure cap for the relevant Years of Assessment. There are 2 methods that companies can use to compute the R&R and PIC expenditure caps. IRAS accepts any of the 2 methods but it must be applied consistently across all expenditure that are subject to an expenditure cap and across all the YAs. The amount carried back must not exceed S$100,000 in the YA in which the qualifying deductions arose. The company has to convert the S$100,000 into non-S$ equivalent using the average exchange rate of the YA in which the qualifying deductions arose. A tax computation is a statement showing the tax adjustments to the accounting profit to arrive at the income that is chargeable to tax. Tax adjustments include non-deductible expenses, non-taxable receipts, further deductions, and capital allowances. Your company should prepare its tax computation annually before completing its Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C. If your company is filing Form C, you must file its audited/ unaudited financial statements, tax computation, and supporting schedules together with Form C. If your company is filing Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite), you do not need to file its financial statements, tax computation, and supporting schedules, but these documents should be ready for submission upon IRAS\u2019 request. Generally, you need to make adjustments to your company\u2019s net profit/ loss.

If your company\u2019s financial statements cover a period that is more than 12 months as a result of a change in financial year end, you may have to apportion and attribute the adjusted profit/ losses to 2 different Years of Assessment. Eligible entities may prepare their financial statements using the Singapore Financial Reporting Standard for Small Entities (SFRS for SE). The Basic Corporate Income Tax Calculator (BTC) is an excel workbook to guide companies in preparing their tax computations and tax schedules when filing their Corporate Income Tax Returns. Companies that prepare their financial statements in non-S$ functional currencies are to prepare their tax computations in the same non-S$ functional currency. However, all amounts declared in the Corporate Income Tax Return must be in S$. The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which a business operates. Your company is required under the Financial Reporting Standards of Singapore (FRS) to determine its functional currency and present its financial statements in that currency.

        "text": "{'content': \"The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) announced that over 2 million employees will benefit from pre-filled tax returns for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2024. This initiative is part of the Auto Inclusion Scheme (AIS), which aims to simplify the tax filing process for employees. Employers are required to submit their employees' employment income data by 1 March 2024 to ensure that the information is pre-filled in the employees' tax returns. Failure to do so may result in penalties. Employers are encouraged to take action early to avoid any last-minute issues and ensure compliance with the submission deadline. This initiative is expected to enhance the efficiency of the tax filing process and provide greater convenience for employees. Over 2 million employees (9 in 10 employees) whose employers are on the Auto-Inclusion Scheme (AIS) will benefit from the convenience of pre-filled tax returns, No-Filing Service (NFS) or Direct Notice of Assessment (D-NOA) for Year of Assessment 2025. This is made possible as the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) extends the AIS to about 120,000 employers, requiring them to electronically submit their employees\u2019 2024 employment income information to IRAS by 1 March 2025, ahead of the tax filing season. The submission requirement applies to all employers that are already on the AIS even if they have less than 5 employees in 2024, and employers that started having 5 or more employees in 2024. Non-compliance is an offence under the Income Tax Act. While the majority of the employers have been compliant, some 11,000 employers missed the AIS deadline in 2024, causing inaccurate or delayed tax assessments for 140,000 employees. Employers that do not file on time commit an offence and cause inconvenience to their employees due to the missing pre-filled employment income information. This year, 12,500 new AIS employers join the growing AIS employer base, and will submit their employees\u2019 income data to IRAS for the first time under the AIS. This brings the number of AIS employers to about 120,000 employers. These employers would have received a letter from IRAS in January 2025 informing them of their AIS obligations. Employers that do not file by 1 March 2025 can be fined up to $5,000. Key personnel of non-compliant businesses such as company directors or precedent partners can also be fined up to $10,000, and/or face imprisonment for a term of up to 12 months. For YA 2024, 1 in 10 employers on the AIS failed to file on time (i.e., late or non-submission). IRAS prosecuted 654 repeat offenders and collected penalties exceeding $790,000 in 2024. These repeat offenders would have received multiple letters, emails and/or calls from IRAS to remind them of their filing obligations. Majority of these employers are in the food and beverage, wholesale trade and construction industries. Employers must ensure the submission of complete and accurate employment income information for their employees to IRAS, as this data will be used to calculate their employees\u2019 tax bills. Common AIS filing errors made by employers include omitting taxable benefits-in-kind (cash/ non-cash) and employee income/ benefits outside the payroll system, incorrect reporting of accommodation benefit, as well as the under-reporting of stock/ options gains. Submitting inaccurate employees\u2019 employment income information is an offence and may result in a penalty up to double the amount of tax undercharged. Employers are encouraged to voluntarily disclose any past errors or omissions in their employees' information immediately, for reduced penalties under IRAS\u2019 Voluntary Disclosure Programme. More details on the Voluntary Disclosure Programme can be found at go.gov.sg/iras-iitvdp. For YA 2025, over 6,000 AIS employers are no longer required to file under the AIS as they have ceased business operations and/or no longer have employees in 2024.\", 'urls': ['https://go.gov.sg/iras-iitvdp']}",

        "text": "Tax Treatment of Gains or Losses from the Sale of Foreign Assets\n\nThis e-Tax Guide explains the income tax treatment of gains or losses from the sale or disposal of any movable or immovable property situated outside Singapore, referred to as \u201cforeign asset.\u201d It is relevant to entities that derive gains or losses from the sale of foreign assets.\n\nCurrently, gains from the sale of foreign assets that are capital in nature are not taxable. To address international tax avoidance risks related to non-taxation of disposal gains in the absence of real economic activities, Singapore has amended its foreign-sourced income regime to subject foreign-sourced disposal gains to tax under specific circumstances. The amendment aligns with Singapore\u2019s focus on anchoring substantive economic activities in Singapore and aligning key areas of the tax regime with international norms.\n\nSingapore will treat gains from the sale or disposal of foreign assets as income chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1947 if the gains are not otherwise chargeable to tax under section 10(1) of the ITA or are otherwise exempt from tax under the ITA. Such gains are referred to as \u201cforeign-sourced disposal gains.\u201d Foreign-sourced disposal gains will be chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(g) of the ITA when the gains are received in Singapore from outside Singapore by a covered entity and if the covered entity that derived the gains does not have adequate economic substance in Singapore or derived the gains from a disposal of foreign Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs).\n\nThe changes will apply to the sale or disposal of a foreign asset that occurs on or after 1 January 2024.\n\nPrior to 1 January 2024, Singapore taxes gains from the sale or disposal of assets as income when the gains are revenue in nature, regardless of whether the income is Singapore-sourced or foreign-sourced. Whether a gain from the sale or disposal of an asset is treated as capital or revenue in nature is determined based on the facts or circumstances of each case and established case law principles. Singapore does not tax gains from the sale or disposal of assets that are capital in nature, whether they are foreign-sourced or Singapore-sourced.\n\nFrom 1 January 2024, under the new foreign-sourced disposal gains tax regime, foreign-sourced disposal gains received in Singapore by an entity of a relevant group from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset will be treated as income chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(g) of the ITA under certain circumstances. The foreign-sourced disposal gains will be subject to tax if the entity does not have adequate economic substance in Singapore or the gains are from the disposal of a foreign IPR.\n\nForeign-sourced disposal gains are regarded as received in Singapore and chargeable to tax if they are remitted to, or transmitted or brought into, Singapore; applied in or towards satisfaction of any debt incurred in respect of a trade or business carried on in Singapore; or applied to the purchase of any movable property which is brought into Singapore. Generally, the foreign-sourced disposal gains are deemed to be received in Singapore only if such gains belong to an entity that is located in Singapore.\n\nOnly entities of relevant groups, referred to as \u201ccovered entities,\u201d will be within the scope of section 10L of the ITA. An entity is a member of a group of entities if its assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and cash flows are included in the consolidated financial statements of the parent entity of the group or excluded from the consolidated financial statements solely on size or materiality grounds or because the entity is held for sale. A group is a relevant group if the entities of the group are not all incorporated, registered, or established in Singapore or if any entity of the group has a place of business outside Singapore.\n\nThe gains from the sale or disposal of any movable or immovable property situated outside Singapore, referred to as \u201ccovered income,\u201d of a covered entity will be subject to tax under section 10L of the ITA. Common examples of assets determined to be situated outside Singapore include immovable property situated outside Singapore, equity securities and debt securities registered in a foreign exchange, unlisted shares issued by a company incorporated outside Singapore, loans where the creditor is a resident in a jurisdiction outside Singapore, and IPRs where the owner is a resident in a jurisdiction outside Singapore.\n\nSection 10L of the ITA will not apply to gains from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset (not being a foreign IPR) when it is carried out as part of, or incidental to, the business activities of certain licensed entities or carried out by an entity that is able to meet the economic substance requirement in Singapore.\n\nForeign-sourced disposal gains from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset will not be brought to tax if the entity has adequate economic substance in the basis period in which the sale or disposal occurs. The economic substance requirement will be assessed at the entity level. A pure equity-holding entity is one whose function is to hold shares or equity interests in any other entity and has no income other than dividends or similar payments from the shares or equity interests, gains on the sale or disposal of the shares or equity interests, or income incidental to its activities of holding shares or equity interests.\n\nTo meet the economic substance requirement, the entity must submit to a public authority any return, statement, or account required under the written law under which it is incorporated or registered, manage and perform its operations in Singapore, and have adequate human resources and premises in Singapore to carry out its operations.\n\nThe tax treatment of gains from the sale or disposal of foreign IPRs is different from that of other foreign assets. The non-taxation of foreign-sourced disposal gains for entities is not applicable to gains from the disposal of foreign IPRs. For gains from the sale or disposal of qualifying foreign IPRs, a modified nexus approach is used to determine the extent of such gains that will not be taxable when received in Singapore.\n\nThe modified nexus ratio is calculated based on qualifying Research and Development (R&D) expenditure incurred in respect of the qualifying IPR to which the qualifying IP income disposal gains relate. Non-qualifying foreign IPRs will have the full amount of the gains from the sale or disposal subject to tax when received in Singapore.\n\nThe following deductions may be allowed to ascertain the amount of gains from the sale or disposal of foreign assets chargeable to tax in Singapore: any expenditure incurred by the entity to acquire, create, or improve the foreign asset; to protect or preserve the value of the foreign asset; or to sell or dispose of the foreign asset. The expenditure will include expenses incurred to finance the acquisition, creation, and improvement of the foreign asset.\n\nCertain expenditures are not deductible, including any expenditure that has been allowed a deduction against any other income or capital expenditure computed by a specific formula. If not all the gains from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset are received in Singapore in the same basis period, a portion of the amount deductible may be apportioned for each basis period in which any such gains are received in Singapore.\n\nThe Comptroller may treat the amount of gains received in Singapore as the amount of the gains if the sale or disposal of a foreign asset was at a price less than the open-market price for the foreign asset. The open-market price is determined based on the price the foreign asset could have been sold for in the open market on the date of its sale or disposal.\n\nThe foreign-sourced disposal gains received in Singapore may have been taxed in the foreign jurisdiction before the gains are received in Singapore. A Singapore tax resident entity may claim double taxation relief, unilateral tax credit, or elect for the foreign tax credit pooling system when claiming the foreign tax credit to alleviate the foreign tax suffered on the foreign-sourced disposal gains.\n\nTax exemption will be given on the capital gains derived from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset where the gains are assessable as the income of an individual. However, tax exemption will not be given if the gains are business revenue gains.\n\nTo ensure that entities keep track of the gains/losses from the disposal of foreign assets and accurately report their taxes, they are required to provide specific information with respect to such gains/losses in their tax computations when submitting their annual income tax returns. Entities are required to retain all records reasonably required for the Comptroller to ascertain the amount of net gains from the disposal of foreign assets chargeable to tax.\n\nYou may make an application for advance ruling to seek certainty on the adequacy of economic substance when a proposed sale or disposal of foreign assets is expected to occur. The advance ruling may be valid for up to five years, including the year relating to the basis period in which the proposed sale or disposal is envisaged to take place.\n\nFor general inquiries or clarifications on this e-Tax guide, please call the provided contact number. \n\nThe document also includes frequently asked questions regarding covered entities, economic substance requirements, and tax treatment under section 10L, along with updates and amendments to the guide. \n\nAnnexes provide additional information on assets determined to be situated outside Singapore, guidance on core income generating activities in relation to the economic substance requirement for each sector, examples of transitional measures for tracking and tracing expenditures of IP assets, computation of foreign-sourced disposal gains, and illustrations of the utilization of losses.",

However, some expenditures are non-deductible.\n\n7. **Double Taxation Relief**:\n   - Entities may claim relief for foreign taxes paid on disposal gains through various mechanisms, including unilateral tax credits.\n\n8. **Reporting Requirements**:\n   - Entities must maintain records and provide specific information regarding gains/losses from foreign asset disposals in their annual tax returns.\n\n9. **Advance Ruling**:\n   - Entities can apply for an advance ruling to clarify the adequacy of their economic substance prior to asset disposal.\n\nThis guide also includes FAQs and annexes with additional details on asset classifications, economic substance activities, and examples for compliance.",

It is crucial for businesses to understand transfer pricing rules to comply with tax regulations and avoid penalties. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) provides guidelines to help businesses establish appropriate pricing methods. Common methods for determining transfer prices include the Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method, the Cost Plus method, and the Resale Price method. Businesses must maintain proper documentation to support their transfer pricing practices and demonstrate compliance with the arm's length principle. Understanding and applying transfer pricing rules is essential for businesses operating in multiple jurisdictions to ensure fair taxation and avoid disputes with tax authorities. Additionally, there are penalties for non-compliance with transfer pricing documentation requirements, which can include fines. Companies must prepare and keep contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation to show that their related party transactions are conducted at arm's length. This documentation must be prepared by the filing due date of the Income Tax Return and retained for at least five years.

        "summary": "Transfer pricing refers to the pricing of goods, services, and intangibles exchanged between related parties, such as subsidiaries of multinational corporations. Understanding transfer pricing rules is essential for compliance with tax regulations and avoiding penalties. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) offers guidelines for establishing appropriate pricing methods, which include the Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method, the Cost Plus method, and the Resale Price method. \n\nBusinesses must maintain proper documentation to support their transfer pricing practices and demonstrate adherence to the arm's length principle, which ensures that transactions are priced as if they were between unrelated parties. This documentation is critical for companies operating in multiple jurisdictions to ensure fair taxation and prevent disputes with tax authorities. \n\nPenalties for non-compliance with transfer pricing documentation requirements can include fines. Companies are required to prepare and retain contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation by the due date of their Income Tax Return, and this documentation must be kept for at least five years. Failure to comply can lead to significant fines and other penalties.",

        "text": "FAQs on Spontaneous Exchange of Information\n\n1. Why did Singapore commit to the spontaneous exchange of information on certain rulings under the OECD framework?\n\nSingapore is a member of the Inclusive Framework (IF) for the global implementation of the BEPS Project. The spontaneous exchange of information on certain rulings is a minimum standard under the BEPS Project to be implemented by IF members.\n\n2. Who will Singapore spontaneously exchange the information with?\n\nSingapore will spontaneously exchange information with a jurisdiction only if that jurisdiction has a tax treaty or exchange of information arrangement with Singapore that provides for the spontaneous exchange of information, has the necessary legal framework and safeguards to ensure confidentiality and appropriate use of the information exchanged, and is similarly committed to compulsory spontaneous exchange of information under the framework. As a general rule, the spontaneous exchange of information on rulings will take place with jurisdictions of residence of all related parties with which the taxpayer enters into transactions for which a ruling is granted or which gives rise to income from related parties benefitting from a preferential treatment, and jurisdictions of residence of the taxpayer\u2019s ultimate parent entity and the immediate parent entity, and in the case of PE rulings, the residence jurisdiction of the PE\u2019s head office.\n\n3. What is the related party threshold for the purpose of spontaneous exchange of information?\n\nTwo parties would be considered related if the first person has a 25% or greater shareholding in the second person or there is a third person that holds a 25% or greater shareholding in both. A person will be treated as holding a percentage shareholding in another person if that person holds directly or indirectly through a shareholding in other persons, that percentage of the voting rights of that person or of the value of any equity interests of that person. The same threshold will apply for other entities such as partnerships and trusts.\n\n4. How will IRAS determine whether a jurisdiction has the necessary legal framework and safeguards to ensure confidentiality and appropriate use of the information exchanged?\n\nThe Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (the Global Forum), which currently comprises more than 140 jurisdictions, including Singapore, is the international body responsible for ensuring the implementation of the internationally agreed standards of transparency and exchange of information in the tax area. It does so through a peer review process which examines a jurisdiction\u2019s legal and regulatory framework, and the implementation of this framework in practice. The assessment of the Global Forum in this regard will strongly influence IRAS\u2019 determination of whether a jurisdiction has the necessary legal framework and safeguards to ensure confidentiality and appropriate use of the information exchanged.\n\n5. When will Singapore spontaneously exchange the information?\n\nRulings issued on or after 1 April 2017 but before 1 January 2025 will be exchanged as soon as possible and no later than three months after the date on which the ruling becomes available to IRAS. Rulings issued on or after 1 January 2025 will be exchanged within six months from the date of issue of the ruling. The date of issue of the ruling is the date the ruling is accepted by the taxpayer.\n\n6. Will taxpayers be informed when their information is exchanged?\n\nAs a matter of practice, taxpayers will not be informed if and when their information is exchanged, or of who the information has been exchanged with. Taxpayers should expect that information falling within the five categories of rulings that Singapore has committed to spontaneously exchange will be exchanged within the timeframe indicated and with the parties as identified.",
        "summary": "**Summary of FAQs on Spontaneous Exchange of Information**\n\n1. **Commitment to Spontaneous Exchange**: Singapore participates in the OECD's BEPS Project and has committed to the spontaneous exchange of information on specific rulings as a minimum standard.\n\n2. **Information Exchange Jurisdictions**: Singapore will exchange information with jurisdictions that have a tax treaty or exchange of information arrangement with it, ensuring confidentiality and appropriate use of the information. This includes jurisdictions of related parties involved in transactions, the taxpayer\u2019s ultimate and immediate parent entities, and the head office of a permanent establishment (PE).\n\n3. **Related Party Definition**: Parties are considered related if one holds a 25% or greater shareholding in the other or if a third party holds a 25% or greater shareholding in both. This threshold applies to entities like partnerships and trusts as well.\n\n4. **Legal Framework Assessment**: The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes assesses jurisdictions' legal frameworks and safeguards for confidentiality. The findings from this peer review process will influence the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) in determining whether to exchange information with a jurisdiction.\n\n5. **Timing of Information Exchange**: Rulings issued between 1 April 2017 and 1 January 2025 will be exchanged within three months of becoming available to IRAS. Rulings issued on or after 1 January 2025 will be exchanged within six months of issuance.\n\n6. **Notification to Taxpayers**: Taxpayers will not be informed when their information is exchanged or with whom it has been exchanged. Information related to the specified categories of rulings will be exchanged within the established timeframes.",

Further guidance on MTT and DTT, such as on the transition rules and safe harbours, will be released progressively.\n\nThis e-Tax guide is relevant to MNE groups with annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more in the CFS of the UPE in at least two of the four preceding FYs, in line with the Pillar Two GloBE rules.\n\nAs announced in the 2024 Budget Statement, Singapore will implement a DTT and the IIR under Pillar Two of the BEPS 2.0 initiative, which will impose a minimum ETR of 15% on businesses\u2019 profits from FYs starting on or after 1 January 2025. The MMT Act has been enacted to implement the IIR (which is referred to as the MTT in the Act) and DTT. The MTT and DTT are based on the published GloBE Model Rules, Commentary and AGs.\n\nMTT and DTT apply to MNE groups with annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more in the CFS of the UPE in at least two out of the four preceding FYs (also known as in-scope MNE groups).\n\nThe UPE of an in-scope MNE group must notify the Comptroller of Income Tax (the \u201cComptroller\u201d) of its liability to be registered under the MMT Act. The Comptroller may register an in-scope MNE group that fails to register.\n\nAll registered MNE groups liable for MTT and/or DTT are required to file tax returns on their top-up tax liability in Singapore. All registered MNE groups are also required to file a GIR with Singapore, unless the GIR is filed with another jurisdiction and in such a case, a GloBE notification (if Singapore will receive the GIR through a filing made in another jurisdiction via exchange of information) must be filed with Singapore.\n\nIn October 2021, the IF agreed on a two-pillar solution (commonly known as BEPS 2.0) to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. As part of Pillar Two under BEPS 2.0, the GloBE Model Rules and its Commentary were released on 20 December 2021 and 14 March 2022, respectively. These, together with AGs issued subsequently, are known as the \u201cGloBE rules\u201d.\n\nThe GloBE rules comprise the IIR and the UTPR. Broadly, the GloBE rules are designed to ensure that in-scope MNE groups pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction where they operate. A top-up tax on excess profits arising in a jurisdiction will be imposed whenever the ETR of the MNE group, determined on a jurisdictional basis, is below the minimum rate of 15%.\n\nThe GloBE rules recognise that jurisdictions may introduce domestic minimum top-up taxes to bring the ETR of LTCEs operating in those jurisdictions to 15%. Where such taxes are regarded as QDMTTs under the GloBE rules, they will reduce the top-up tax that would otherwise arise under IIR or UTPR in respect of such LTCEs.\n\nSingapore will implement MTT and DTT for businesses\u2019 FYs starting on or after 1 January 2025. The MTT and DTT are based on the published GloBE Model Rules, Commentary and AGs. A summary table of provisions in the MMT Act, and (if applicable) the corresponding provisions in the published GloBE Model Rules, Commentary and AGs, is at Annex B.\n\nMTT and DTT will apply to an MNE group for a FY beginning on or after 1 January 2025. For this purpose, the FY is generally determined based on the accounting period of the UPE\u2019s CFS.\n\nThis means that if the CFS of the UPE of an MNE group are prepared for an accounting period from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025, MTT and DTT will apply to in-scope entities of that MNE group whose financial results are consolidated into that CFS for the same period i.e. 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. This applies even if the FYs of some of the in-scope entities do not begin from 1 January 2025 (e.g. the entities\u2019 FY could be from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025 for their individual financial accounts, but they will nonetheless be considered as in-scope entities from 1 January 2025).\n\nMTT and DTT apply to an MNE group that has annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more in the CFS of the UPE in at least two of the four FYs immediately preceding the tested FY (the \u201crevenue threshold\u201d). The following table illustrates how the revenue threshold is to be applied:\n\nWhen determining whether an MNE group meets the revenue threshold, the annual revenue threshold of EUR 750 million is adjusted proportionally to correspond with the period covered by the relevant FY. For example, if a FY of an MNE group consists of only 9 months, then the applicable annual revenue threshold for that particular FY will be EUR 562.5 million (750 million x 9/12).\n\nNotwithstanding Section 5, certain entities are not subject to the MTT and DTT (i.e. excluded entities). MTT and DTT adopt the same scope of excluded entities as the GloBE rules. This means that:\n\na. Attributes of excluded entities such as their profits, losses, taxes accrued, tangible assets, and payroll expenses are excluded from the various computations under MTT and DTT including the de minimis exclusion.\n\nb. However, the revenue of excluded entities would still be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the revenue threshold of the MNE group in paragraph 5.1 is met.\n\nc. Excluded entities do not have any administrative obligations under MTT and DTT, such as the filing of a GIR.\n\nExamples of excluded entities include a governmental entity, an international organisation and a non-profit organisation. Please refer to Article 1.5 of the GloBE Model Rules and its accompanying Commentary for further information.\n\nBesides excluded entities, the MTT and DTT regimes also provide for the following three types of exclusions in accordance with the GloBE rules as stated below. These three types of exclusions affect the computation of the top-up amount under the GloBE rules. They do not affect the determination of whether the revenue threshold of the MNE group is met and the administrative obligations for the MNE group under the MTT and DTT regimes:\n\na. International Shipping Income Exclusion: A CE\u2019s international shipping income or qualified ancillary international shipping income is excluded from the computation of its GloBE income or loss if the strategic or commercial management of all ships concerned is effectively carried on within the jurisdiction where the CE is located.\n\nb. SBIE: The SBIE provides for a formulaic, substance-based carve-out, based on a percentage of the eligible payroll costs and carrying value of eligible tangible assets of the MNE group. The SBIE seeks to exclude a fixed return for substantive activities within a jurisdiction from the application of the GloBE rules.\n\nc. De Minimis Exclusion: MNE groups may make an annual election for the de minimis exclusion. To qualify for a de minimis exclusion for a jurisdiction for a FY, (a) the average GloBE revenue of CEs (not being stateless entities, investment entities or insurance investment entities) in the jurisdiction for that FY and the two preceding FYs must be less than EUR 10 million and (b) the average GloBE income of those CEs for the same period must be less than EUR 1 million or the CEs must be in a loss position. If so, the top-up amounts for that FY of those CEs are deemed to be nil.\n\nThe MTT and DTT regimes also provide for safe harbours that help reduce the MNE groups\u2019 compliance burden (e.g. avoiding the need for detailed MTT or DTT calculations). Where a safe harbour is elected by an MNE group for a jurisdiction, the top-up amounts for qualifying entities of the MNE group in the jurisdiction are treated as nil. Currently, the GloBE rules provide for four safe harbours:\n\nSafe harbours (a) to (c) mentioned above will treat the top-up amounts under MTT, DTT or both (as the case may be) as nil, where applicable.\n\nMTT applies to a Singapore parent entity\u2019s ownership interest in its relevant entities outside Singapore and its stateless entities but does not apply to its ownership interest in its domestic entities. The minimum rate for MTT is 15% and the top-up amount is computed using the ETR that is calculated on a jurisdictional basis for an MNE group.\n\nAn entity is a chargeable entity for MTT if it is a responsible member located in Singapore of an MNE group and holds an ownership interest in a CE located outside Singapore or a stateless entity of the MNE group that has a top-up amount for the FY (called a relevant entity).\n\nA responsible member of an MNE group is any of the following entities located in Singapore or subject to a qualified IIR in the jurisdiction where it is located:\n\na. the UPE of the MNE group;\n\nb. an intermediate parent entity of the MNE group if no other member of the MNE group that owns a controlling interest in the entity is a responsible member (e.g. the UPE);\n\nc. a partially-owned parent entity of the MNE group if it is not wholly-owned by another partially-owned parent entity of the MNE group that is a responsible member.\n\nThe amount of MTT chargeable on a chargeable entity for a FY is the sum of the top-up tax of each relevant entity of the chargeable entity for the FY.\n\nWhere the chargeable entity holds its indirect ownership interest in a relevant entity X through another responsible member of the MNE group, the amount of MTT payable by the chargeable entity is reduced by the proportionate amount of MTT or any qualified IIR payable by that responsible member in respect of the relevant entity X. This situation may arise, for example, when the chargeable entity is a UPE and holds an ownership interest in another responsible member that is a partially-owned parent entity; hence both the chargeable entity and that responsible member would pay respectively MTT or qualified IIR in respect of the same relevant entity.\n\nFor a relevant entity (that is not an investment entity or an insurance investment entity) of a chargeable entity, the top-up tax for a FY is computed as follows:\n\nTop-up tax = (Top-up amount of the relevant entity for the FY) x (Chargeable entity\u2019s inclusion ratio for the relevant entity for the FY)\n\nThe chargeable entity\u2019s inclusion ratio for a relevant entity for a FY is the proportion of the GloBE income of the relevant entity for the FY that is not attributable to entities other than the chargeable entity.\n\nIn accordance with the GloBE rules, separate computations of top-up amount are required for each category of entities, or each special entity as the case may be.\n\nThe top-up amount of a CE that is not a special entity is determined as follows:\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1: For each CE in the MNE group,\na. Determine GloBE income or loss\nb. Determine adjusted covered taxes\n\nStep 2: For each jurisdiction,\na. Aggregate the GloBE income or loss of all CEs (that are not special entities) located in that jurisdiction\nb. Aggregate the adjusted covered taxes of all those CEs\nc. Determine ETR for that jurisdiction by dividing (b) by (a)\n\nStep 3: For each of those jurisdictions with ETR below 15% or have an additional current top-up amount,\na. Determine the jurisdictional top-up amount\nb. Determine the top-up amount of each CE (that is not a special entity) by apportioning the jurisdictional top-up amount\n\nThe jurisdictional top-up amount for the MNE group for a jurisdiction for a FY is determined as follows:\n\n(Top-up tax percentage x Excess profits) + Additional current top-up amount - Qualified domestic minimum top-up tax\n\nThe top-up tax percentage for the MNE group for a jurisdiction for a FY is the difference between the minimum rate of 15% and the ETR for the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the FY (if the ETR is less than 15%). The top-up tax percentage is nil if the ETR for the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the FY is 15% or more.\n\nThe excess profits for the MNE group for a jurisdiction for a FY is the sum of the GloBE income or loss for the FY of the CEs (not being special entities) of the MNE group located in the jurisdiction less the SBIE for the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the FY. The excess profits for the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the FY cannot be less than nil.\n\nThe jurisdictional top-up amount for the MNE group for a jurisdiction for the FY is apportioned between the CEs (not being special entities) of the MNE group that are located in that jurisdiction. The apportionment is generally based on the GloBE income of the CEs for the FY.\n\nThe top-up amount of an entity that is a special entity is determined as follows:\n\nType of special entity Treatment\n\nStateless entity: Top-up amount is determined in a similar manner as paragraph 7.3.7 above and modified accordingly for these respective special entities so that separate ETRs will apply to these special entities.\n\nMinority-owned CE and member of a minority-owned subgroup: Top-up amount is determined in a similar manner as paragraph 7.3.7 above except as specified below. The ETR of an investment entity or insurance investment entity is calculated separately from any other CEs in the same jurisdiction. If the MNE group owns interests in investment entities or multiple insurance entities located in the same jurisdiction, a single ETR is computed for all such entities in the jurisdiction.\n\nThe calculations for MTT are to be carried out in the presentation currency of the UPE\u2019s CFS.\n\nDTT is a tax imposed in Singapore on MNE groups that meet the revenue threshold in paragraph 5.1, in addition to CIT.\n\nDTT applies to in-scope entities of an MNE group. It does not apply to a wholly domestic group.\n\nIn-scope entities for DTT refer to the following categories of entities of or connected to an MNE group:\n\na. the members (including partially owned CEs) of the MNE group located in Singapore;\n\nb. joint ventures and JV subsidiaries located in Singapore;\n\nc. members of a minority-owned subgroup, and minority-owned CEs located in Singapore; and\n\nd. reverse hybrid entities which are formed, registered or incorporated in Singapore; and are not responsible members.\n\nDTT does not apply to CEs that are located outside Singapore, excluded entities, stateless permanent establishments and tax transparent entities of MNE groups. MTT, qualified IIR or qualified UTPR may apply to these entities instead. For investment entities and insurance investment entities that are located in Singapore, the top-up amount of these entities is treated as nil for DTT purpose.\n\nDTT is applicable to in-scope entities of the MNE group located in Singapore that are excluded from the UTPR under Article 9.3 of GloBE Model Rules.\n\nDTT is designed to meet the conditions of a QDMTT such that the DTT liability will be offset against any IIR/UTPR liabilities in respect of low-taxed profits of in-scope entities located in Singapore that may arise from the application of the GloBE rules in other jurisdictions.\n\nDTT is also designed to satisfy the requirements of the QDMTT Safe Harbour. Where the QDMTT Safe Harbour applies under the GloBE rules in other jurisdictions, the application of the GloBE rules in these jurisdictions is turned off by treating any top-up tax payable under the GloBE rules to be nil. In this way, MNE groups only undertake one computation for QDMTT (i.e. DTT in Singapore) without the need to make a further calculation under the GloBE rules in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe DTT ensures that in-scope entities of an MNE group located in Singapore will be charged a top-up amount (that is, the DTT) if their jurisdictional ETR is below 15%. This will raise the ETR of the MNE group to 15% in Singapore. DTT is calculated in a similar way to MTT with the exceptions highlighted in paragraphs 8.7.1 and 9.1.\n\nA CE in Singapore, known as a DFE, will be chargeable with DTT of an MNE group, unless the MNE group makes an election to allocate a specified amount of the DTT to a qualifying CE. A qualifying CE does not include a:\n\na. CE with GloBE loss;\n\nb. CE which is a flow-through entity that is not a reverse hybrid entity;\n\nc. CE with ETR of 15% or more; and\n\nd. CE which is no longer in the MNE group e.g. the CE has left the MNE group or ceased to exist after the reported FY.\n\nIf the DFE does not pay DTT on-time resulting in DTT in arrears, every CE located in Singapore of an MNE group, joint venture and JV subsidiary located in Singapore which are connected with the MNE group, and reverse hybrid entity of the MNE group will be jointly and severally liable for the DTT or interest in arrears for the FY that the DTT relates to.\n\nThe top-up amount of the MNE group is the sum of the following:\n\na. the top-up amount of the CEs (other than special entities) located in Singapore;\n\nb. the top-up amount of any joint venture and JV subsidiary located in Singapore;\n\nc. the top-up amount of the members of a minority-owned subgroup and minority-owned CEs located in Singapore; and\n\nd. the top-up amount of each reverse hybrid entity (not being a responsible member) formed, registered or incorporated in Singapore.\n\nSimilar to MTT, separate computation of top-up amount for each category of entities, or each special entity is required.\n\nThe tax payable under DTT is the whole jurisdictional top-up amount, regardless of the level of ownership interest of the parent entity in the in-scope entities.\n\nThe jurisdictional top-up amount is computed based on the following formula:\n\n(Top-up tax percentage x Excess profits) + Additional current top-up amount\n\nThe top-up tax percentage is the difference between the 15% minimum rate and the ETR of the MNE group in Singapore, while the excess profits is the difference between the sum of the GloBE income or loss of the entities located in Singapore less the SBIE for those entities.\n\nThe computation of DTT is in accordance with the GloBE rules and the conditions for QDMTT and QDMTT Safe Harbour. In particular, for the purpose of computing ETR in Singapore, DTT does not take into account the allocation of cross-border taxes such as CFC taxes incurred by a parent entity or taxes incurred by a foreign main entity with respect to profits attributable to its permanent establishment in Singapore.\n\nThe DTT computations are based on the financial statements prepared in accordance with the LFAS rule subject to the conditions therein.\n\nThe local financial accounting standards refer to:\n\n\u2022 Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I));\n\u2022 Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS); or\n\u2022 Singapore Financial Reporting Standards for Small Entities (SFRS for SE)\n\nDTT computation will be determined based on LFAS if all the CEs of the MNE group located in Singapore have financial statements prepared in accordance with the accounting standards made or formulated under Part 3 of Singapore\u2019s Accounting Standards Act 2007 and:\n\n\u2022 the CEs are required to keep or use such accounts under any written law in Singapore; or\n\u2022 such financial statements are audited by an external financial auditor.\n\nWhere not all CEs located in Singapore meet the above requirements or the FY of their financial statements is different from the FY of the CFS of the UPE, the DTT computations shall be computed based on the financial accounting standard used in the preparation of the CFS of the UPE.\n\nThe table below summarises the key differences between MTT and DTT.\n\nMTT is a tax imposed on the low-taxed income of CEs, joint ventures and JV subsidiaries located outside Singapore and stateless CEs. DTT is imposed on the low-taxed income of CEs, joint ventures and JV subsidiaries located in Singapore, and reverse hybrid entities formed, registered or incorporated in Singapore which are not responsible members.\n\nMTT applies to investment entities and insurance investment entities. DTT does not apply to investment entities and insurance investment entities.\n\nThe parent entity that is a responsible member located in Singapore is responsible for MTT. The DFE and/or qualifying entity referred to in paragraph 8.5.1 is responsible for DTT.\n\nThe filing process for MTT and DTT will be treated as complete without a need for IRAS to assess the tax and issue a notice of assessment. IRAS may select MTT and DTT returns filed by taxpayers for audit as part of IRAS\u2019 regular compliance reviews. If IRAS is of the view that the MTT or DTT declared is inaccurate, IRAS may issue a notice of assessment to revise the tax payable. If the MNE group disagrees with IRAS\u2019 assessment, it can object to the assessment within two months of the service of the notice of assessment.\n\nThe UPE of an MNE group that has a CE or a JV located in Singapore or a reverse hybrid entity formed, registered or incorporated in Singapore (not being a responsible member) must notify the Comptroller of the MNE group\u2019s liability to be registered under the MMT Act. The registration is a one-time process, and the registration form will be available digitally. The registration must be made within six months after the first FYE of the UPE where MTT or DTT, or both, applies to the MNE group (or such extended time as the Comptroller may allow).\n\nThe MNE group will be required to designate a single Singapore CE to be the DFE and GFE to fulfil tax obligations in Singapore. The same CE will be designated as the DFE and GFE. The rules in determining the DFE and GFE of an MNE group are set out below:\n\nWhere the UPE is a legal entity located in Singapore, and is not an excluded entity, the UPE is the DFE/GFE.\n\nOtherwise, an intermediate parent entity that is a legal entity located in Singapore, is the parent entity of all other Singapore CEs and is not an excluded entity, is the DFE/GFE.\n\nIf there is no such UPE/IPE, any CE in Singapore can be designated as the DFE/GFE if the designated CE is a legal entity located in Singapore, or if no such legal entity exists, a permanent establishment located in Singapore (including a branch of a foreign company registered in Singapore).\n\nWhere the MNE group does not have a CE that meets the above requirements, the Comptroller must deem a CE of the MNE group located in Singapore, a joint venture or JV subsidiary located in Singapore and connected to the MNE group or a reverse hybrid entity of the MNE group, to be the DFE/GFE.\n\nThe appointment of the DFE/GFE must be made within six months after the first FYE of the UPE where MTT or DTT, or both, applies to the MNE group (or such extended time as the Comptroller may allow). The first appointment of the DFE/GFE is made together with the registration of the MNE group.\n\nIf the DFE/GFE no longer exists or no longer belongs to the group, the UPE must inform the Comptroller of the new DFE/GFE no later than a month after the DFE/GFE ceases to be a part of the group or such extended time as the Comptroller may allow.\n\nThe MNE group will be required to designate another Singapore CE as the new DFE/GFE. The newly appointed DFE/GFE will be required to carry out any duty of the previous DFE/GFE that has yet to be fulfilled as at the date of new appointment.\n\nThe table below sets out the key timelines for MTT and DTT, and the entity responsible for fulfilling the respective obligations:\n\nThe filing of tax returns for MTT and DTT will be available in digital service. The GIR is a standardised information return required under the GloBE rules. By default, every Singapore CE of an MNE group will have an obligation to file a GIR with IRAS, regardless of where the MNE group is headquartered. The GFE of a registered MNE group in Singapore is required to file the GIR annually with IRAS on behalf of its represented entities in Singapore.\n\nA foreign CE, such as the UPE of a foreign MNE group, may file a GIR centrally in a foreign jurisdiction. Where a GIR has been filed in another jurisdiction outside Singapore and Singapore has an information exchange agreement with that foreign jurisdiction to receive the GIR, the GFE in Singapore will not be required to file a GIR with IRAS. However, the GFE will still be required to file a GloBE notification annually with IRAS. The notification will inform IRAS of the identity of the filing CE (e.g. the foreign UPE) and where the GIR is filed. This is to facilitate the transmission of the GIR to IRAS via automatic exchange of information.\n\nThe parent entity that is a responsible member located in Singapore, the DFE and the GFE are responsible for submitting the MTT return, DTT return and GIR/GloBE notification respectively.\n\nThe due date for submission of the MTT and DTT returns and the GIR/GloBE notification will be 15 months after the end of each FY (or 18 months if the FY is a transition year). If the MTT or DTT returns are not submitted by the filing due date, IRAS may estimate the MTT or DTT payable and issue a notice of assessment.\n\nIf an MNE group chooses to file its GIR centrally in an implementing jurisdiction according to Article 8.1.2 of the GloBE Model Rules, the information in the GIR will be disseminated to other implementing jurisdictions where the MNE group is operating in based on an approach that has been agreed by the IF.\n\nThe record-keeping periods for MTT and DTT are as follows:\n\nThe records to be kept for MTT and DTT purposes are generally aligned with the records to be kept for CIT or accounting purposes. Examples of records are general ledgers, invoices, accounting records and schedules, bank statements and pre-consolidated accounts.\n\nAn extended record-keeping period is applicable to supporting documents substantiating the calculation of the provisions in the GloBE rules that require looking back at the MNE group\u2019s past years\u2019 figures. In such cases, the supporting documents are to be kept for up to ten years (i.e. beyond the general record keeping period of five years). The extended record keeping period is required for IRAS to verify the accuracy of the computations done by the MNE group.\n\nThe statutory time limits to raise an assessment for MTT and DTT are as follows:\n\nThe parent entity that is a responsible member located in Singapore and the DFE are responsible for the payment of MTT and DTT respectively.\n\nFor DTT purpose, the DFE can elect under section 45 of the MMT Act to have a qualifying entity in the group (X) to be allocated a share of the MNE group\u2019s DTT liability. If the election is made, X will be responsible for payment of that amount to IRAS and the DFE will be liable to pay the remaining MNE group\u2019s DTT. The election can be made on a yearly basis at the point of filing the DTT return and is irrevocable for that FY.\n\nThe due date for payment of MTT and DTT is no later than one month after the filing due date of the MTT and DTT return respectively. Where the Comptroller issues a notice of assessment, the due date for payment of the MTT or DTT is within one month after the service of the notice.\n\nWhere MTT or DTT has been computed in a currency other than Singapore dollars, the tax payable in foreign currency needs to be converted into Singapore dollars for payment to IRAS. The exchange rate to be used is the average exchange rate, as made available by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, calculated on the basis of the rate of exchange at the end of each month for that FY.\n\nThe time periods for the repayment of MTT and DTT and the claiming of relief for error or mistake in respect of an MTT and DTT return, are aligned with the statutory time limits for MTT and DTT assessments respectively.\n\nA claim for repayment, or an application for relief, must be made no later than:\n\nThe UPE of a registered MNE group must inform the Comptroller of the following events:\n\nPenalties (including composition amounts or fines) and/or surcharges may be imposed under the MMT Act where an in-scope MNE group fails to meet its obligations for MTT and DTT. As MTT and DTT rules are new, MNEs will require time to familiarise themselves with the rules. In view that some MNEs have given feedback that such rules are complex, IRAS will adopt a light touch approach for the first three FYs from FY 2025 (i.e. FY 2025-FY 2027), if an MNE group can demonstrate that it has taken reasonable measures to ensure the correct application of the rules.\n\nMTT and DTT are taxes charged on the income of an MNE group. They are not incurred in the production of income. Thus, they are not deductible for CIT purposes in Singapore, under section 15(1)(g) of the ITA.\n\nAny qualified IIR, qualified UTPR and QDMTT or taxes substantially similar to these taxes are not allowed for tax deduction for CIT purposes in Singapore.\n\nQualified IIR, qualified UTPR and QDMTT refer to taxes imposed by the law of another jurisdiction that are prescribed by the Minister in the regulations as being equivalent in effect as the MTT, tax imposed by the UTPR in the GloBE rules, and DTT respectively.\n\nIn terms of rule order, qualified IIR and qualified UTPR (or substantially similar taxes) imposed by other jurisdictions (\u201cforeign GloBE taxes\u201d) are to be imposed after the application of CIT in Singapore. Allowing a deduction for foreign GloBE taxes for CIT purposes would thus create circularity in the charging of CIT under the ITA. Tax deduction is therefore not allowed on such amounts.\n\nA QDMTT is a form of tax on income, as the tax base in the computation of QDMTT is premised on the entity\u2019s accounting profits (i.e. income). Hence, similar to DTT, QDMTT (or substantially similar taxes) imposed by other jurisdictions, are disallowed for tax deduction for CIT purposes in Singapore.\n\nFor CIT purposes in Singapore, FTC may be allowed on foreign DMTT paid or payable on:\n\nFor the Singapore CE to qualify for FTC claims in Singapore on foreign DMTT paid or payable, the following conditions must be met:\n\nFor dividend income derived by the Singapore CE, the FTC will take into account the underlying tax paid by the dividend-paying company in the foreign jurisdiction.\n\nFor the purpose of granting the FTC, the portion of foreign DMTT in respect of which FTC may be allowed must be clearly attributed to the remitted (or deemed remitted) income. If there is no clear attribution of the taxes to the remitted (or deemed remitted) income, no FTC will be allowed.\n\nFTC will not be allowed for foreign GloBE taxes for CIT purposes in Singapore. In terms of rule order, foreign GloBE taxes are to be imposed after the application of income tax. Providing FTC in Singapore for foreign GloBE taxes creates circularity, since the foreign GloBE taxes are determined after taking into account the income tax payable (net of FTC) of the Singapore CE. In addition, the foreign GloBE taxes are payable by a parent entity and not by the entity who derives the income.\n\nUnder the FSIE scheme, foreign-sourced dividends, foreign branch profits and foreign sourced service income received by resident taxpayers in Singapore are exempt from tax if all the following conditions are met:\n\nUnder the FTC pooling system, resident taxpayers in Singapore may elect for FTC pooling if all the following conditions are met:\n\nWhen determining whether the \u201csubject to tax\u201d condition is met under FSIE and FTC pooling system:\n\nIf the highest corporate tax rate of a foreign jurisdiction of source in the year the foreign income is remitted (or deemed remitted to Singapore) from that foreign jurisdiction is at least 15%, the \u201cforeign headline tax rate of at least 15%\u201d condition for FSIE and FTC pooling system is considered to be met.\n\nAny request for clarification on the e-Tax guide can be sent to IRAS_Pillar_Two@iras.gov.sg.",
        "summary": "The article outlines the implementation of the Multinational Enterprise Top-up Tax (MTT) and Domestic Top-up Tax (DTT) in Singapore, effective for financial years (FYs) starting on or after January 1, 2025, as part of the OECD's BEPS 2.0 initiative. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Scope and Applicability**:\n   - MTT and DTT apply to multinational enterprise (MNE) groups with annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more in their consolidated financial statements (CFS) for at least two of the four preceding FYs.\n   - The Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) of an in-scope MNE group must notify the Comptroller of Income Tax of its registration under the MMT Act.\n\n2. **Tax Rates**:\n   - Both MTT and DTT impose a minimum effective tax rate (ETR) of 15% on profits. If the ETR is below this threshold, a top-up tax will be applied to bring it up to 15%.\n\n3. **Filing Requirements**:\n   - Registered MNE groups must file tax returns for MTT and DTT in Singapore. A Global Information Return (GIR) is also required unless filed in another jurisdiction, in which case a GloBE notification must be submitted to Singapore.\n\n4. **Excluded Entities**:\n   - Certain entities, such as governmental bodies, international organizations, and non-profits, are excluded from MTT and DTT calculations, although their revenues are considered for the revenue threshold.\n\n5. **Exclusions and Safe Harbours**:\n   - Specific exclusions apply to international shipping income, substance-based income exclusions (SBIE), and a de minimis exclusion for small entities.\n   - Safe harbours are available to reduce compliance burdens, allowing MNE groups to treat top-up amounts as nil under certain conditions.\n\n6. **Computation of Taxes**:\n   - The top-up amount is calculated based on the GloBE income, adjusted covered taxes, and the ETR for each jurisdiction. The jurisdictional top-up amount is apportioned among the relevant entities based on their GloBE income.\n\n7. **DTT Specifics**:\n   - DTT applies to entities located in Singapore and is designed to offset any low-taxed profits arising from GloBE rules in other jurisdictions.\n   - The DTT is calculated similarly to MTT but focuses on income generated within Singapore.\n\n8. **Compliance and Penalties**:\n   - The filing process is digital, and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance. A light-touch approach will be adopted for the first three FYs to assist MNEs in adapting to the new rules.\n\n9. **Tax Deductibility**:\n   - MTT and DTT are not deductible for corporate income tax (CIT) purposes in Singapore, and similar foreign taxes are also disallowed for deduction.\n\n10. **Foreign Tax Credits (FTC)**:\n    - FTC may be allowed for foreign DMTT paid, provided certain conditions are met, but not for foreign GloBE taxes.\n\n11. **Record-Keeping and Timelines**:\n    - Record-keeping periods align with CIT requirements, with extended periods for certain supporting documents. The due date for MTT and DTT returns is 15 months after the end of each FY.\n\nThis guide serves as a comprehensive overview of the MTT and DTT regimes, detailing their application, compliance requirements, and implications for MNEs operating in Singapore.",

Corporate income tax is a tax on the income of companies, levied on the profits earned by companies in Singapore. The current corporate income tax rate is 17%, but there are various tax exemptions and incentives available for companies. Start-up companies can enjoy tax exemptions on their first S$100,000 of chargeable income for the first three consecutive years of assessment. Companies must file their corporate income tax returns annually, with a deadline typically on 30 November each year. Tax payments are due within one month from the date of the Notice of Assessment issued by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). Understanding corporate income tax is crucial for companies operating in Singapore to ensure compliance and take advantage of available incentives. Companies are required to file the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C for the Year of Assessment immediately after the year of incorporation, even if they have not received any filing notification. If a company closes its first set of accounts in the year of incorporation, it must file the ECI within three months from the first financial year end. Companies must maintain proper records of their financial transactions for at least five years from the relevant Year of Assessment.

        "text": "Guidance on Tax Deductible Donations\n\nThis e-Tax Guide sets out what contributions made to an Institution of A Public Character (IPC) or a Grant-Making Philanthropic Organisation (Grant-maker) are considered donations and eligible for tax deduction under the Income Tax Act 1947 (ITA); and the differences between donations and sponsorships.\n\nThis e-Tax Guide will be relevant to you if you are an IPC, a Grant-maker, or a potential donor.\n\nIPCs and Grant-makers may use this guide to determine whether the contribution which they receive should (a) be regarded as a donation or sponsorship, and (b) if the contribution is considered a donation, whether the donation qualifies for enhanced tax deduction for income tax purposes. IPCs should read this e-Tax Guide in conjunction with the e-Tax Guide on Tax Treatment on Donations with Benefits, which deals with the specific scenario where donors receive benefits when they make tax deductible donations.\n\nGlossary\n\nInstitution of A Public Character as defined under section 40 of the Charities Act 1994: A registered charity or an exempt charity in Singapore that is approved as an institution of a public character by the Minister, Commissioner of Charities, or any Sector Administrator on the application of the charity; or which is deemed as an institution of a public character under any written law.\n\nGrant-making Philanthropic Organisation: A grant-making philanthropic organisation registered with IRAS under the Income Tax (Grant-Making Philanthropic Organisations) Regulations 2009.\n\nHereinafter, references to IPC(s) in this guide should be taken to include the references to Grant-makers.\n\nBackground\n\nTo encourage philanthropy and altruistic giving, the Government provides enhanced tax deductions on certain donations made to IPCs (\u201ctax deductible donations\u201d) under section 37(3) of the ITA. For the donors to enjoy the enhanced tax deductions on their donations, IPCs are required to issue tax deduction receipts to the donors. As granting such enhanced tax deduction results in tax revenue foregone by the Government, IPCs must ensure that tax deduction receipts are issued only in respect of tax deductible donations.\n\nIPCs may source for donations and sponsorships to fund their activities. When a person contributes to an IPC, the person may receive enhanced income tax deduction in respect of the contribution if the contribution is a donation that met the relevant conditions. When the person\u2019s contribution to the IPC is a sponsorship, the person is not entitled to enhanced income tax deduction, and IPCs should not issue tax deduction receipts for such contributions. Instead, the sponsors may claim these sponsorships as business expenses when they file their income tax returns if these expenses were tax deductible expenses under section 14 of the ITA (i.e. revenue expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of their income).\n\nWhat is a Donation\n\nA donation is generally an unconditional and voluntary gift to the recipient without expectation of any benefit in return. The main test determining whether a contribution is a donation depends on the intention of the person making the contribution. If a person would not have made the contribution to an IPC but for the fact that he would receive a benefit-in-return, the contribution to the IPC would not be considered a donation. That said, the fact that a person receives a benefit-in-return in connection with his contribution to an IPC does not automatically mean that his contribution is not a donation. Whether a contribution constitutes a donation will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. This e-Tax Guide highlights some factors which would disqualify a contribution from being regarded as a donation, as well as some illustrative examples on what constitutes a donation.\n\nTax Deductibility of Donations\n\nThe following three criteria can be used by IPCs to determine if a contribution qualifies as a tax deductible donation:\n\na) The contribution must fall within one of the categories of donation specified in section 37(3)(c), (e) and (f) of the ITA as detailed in Annex A;\n\nb) The contribution is a free-will gift for which the giver relinquishes and confers all his rights, control and ownership over the gift to the IPC when the contribution is made;\n\nc) If the contribution is subject to any condition specified by the donor as to the purpose for which the contribution may be applied, all the three requirements under section 37(3C) of the ITA must be satisfied.\n\nIPCs may issue tax deduction receipts to donors in respect of tax deductible donations that meet all the above three criteria. Where a contribution does not fulfil any of the three criteria above, the contribution is not a tax deductible donation and IPCs must not issue tax deduction receipts in respect of the contribution.\n\nA contribution will not qualify as a tax deductible donation if the contribution is governed by an agreement which includes any of the following attributes and IPCs must not issue tax deduction receipts in respect of such contributions:\n\na) The contribution agreement contains a refund clause, where the IPC is obliged to refund (wholly or in part) the contribution or make other compensation arrangements to the contributor;\n\nb) The contribution agreement contains an \u2018exclusivity\u2019 clause which prevents the IPC from accepting funds/contributions from and/or acknowledging other contributors/donors, regardless of whether the latter are from the same industry as the contributor;\n\nc) The contribution arrangement is in substance a commercial arrangement or an exchange of monies for benefits. Such arrangements include outright sales of goods or services, instances where the contributor derives substantial commercial benefits from the contribution arrangement, or instances where the contributor retains contractual rights over the sum contributed.\n\nContributions made under agreements with these attributes will not qualify as tax deductible donations as the contributions would not be consistent with a free-will gift where the contributor relinquishes and confers all his rights, control and ownership over the gift to the IPC when the contribution is made.\n\nRefund clause vs statutory obligation to refund\n\nWhile Regulation 11(7) of the Charities (Institutions of A Public Character) Regulations requires an IPC to return the donated funds if it is unable to carry out the project for which it has specifically raised funds for, this is a statutory obligation, and does not impose a requirement on the IPC to include a refund clause in the contribution agreement. The inclusion of a refund clause in the contribution agreement indicates that the contribution is not a free-will gift as it creates a contractual obligation that is commercial in nature. Such a contribution agreement would thus be classified as a sponsorship and would not be eligible for enhanced tax deductions.\n\nIPCs should refer to the IPC Regulations for the legal requirements and circumstances under which the obligation under Reg 11(7) applies. For avoidance of doubt, a clause where the IPC commits to adhere to the IPC Regulations does not constitute a refund clause. To assure donors that IPCs are adhering to their statutory obligations regarding the donations, IPCs may wish to refer donors to the IPC Regulations.\n\nDonations with benefits\n\nWhere a donor, or a person connected with the donor, receives a benefit in return for a tax deductible donation made, the enhanced tax deduction is only granted on the difference between the donation and the value of the benefit under section 37(3G) of the ITA. Enhanced tax deduction will not be granted if the contribution is ascertained to be a sponsorship.\n\nNotwithstanding the rule, to further encourage philanthropic giving, certain donations made to IPC may be deemed to be pure donations as a concession, notwithstanding there is a benefit given in return for the donation. These benefits are treated as having no commercial value under the concessionary tax treatment outlined in the e-Tax Guide on Tax Treatment on Donations with Benefits.\n\nWhat is a Sponsorship\n\nSponsorships (whether in-kind or in cash) are arrangements which typically entail a defined set of rights, opportunities, and benefits to the sponsor to be fulfilled by the IPC in exchange for the sponsorship monies. The sponsor will typically support an activity or event by making a contribution to the IPC and in the process, the sponsor receives certain commercial benefits, although the value of the benefits could be lower than the value of the support provided. This is unlike a donation where the intent is to make an unconditional and voluntary gift to the IPC without expectation of any benefit in return, to support its charitable objects.\n\nIf a contributor would not have made the contribution but for the fact that he would receive a benefit in return, regardless of whether the value of the contribution is higher than the value of the benefits received (i.e. the contribution is not a free-will gift), the full contribution would not be a donation. Whether the contribution made to an IPC tantamount to a sponsorship ultimately depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.\n\nTax Deductibility of Sponsorships\n\nSponsorships are not eligible for enhanced tax deduction under section 37(3) of the ITA. Such sponsorships of monies, goods or services may, however, be expenses allowable for tax deduction under section 144 of the ITA if such expenses are considered as being incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income and are not explicitly prohibited under section 155 of the ITA. These include payments made to advertise the sponsor\u2019s goods and services. Sponsors may claim these sponsorship expenses when they file their income tax returns.\n\nIPCs should determine whether a contribution is a sponsorship or a donation by reviewing the terms of the agreement with the contributor and bearing in mind the principles and factors set out in paragraphs 6.1 and 6.3 above. IPCs should not issue tax deduction receipts for sponsorships. IPCs should also take note that the tax treatments stated in the e-Tax Guide on Tax Treatment on Donations with Benefits apply only to donations and not sponsorships.\n\nIn the event of wrongful issuance of tax deduction receipts, the enhanced tax deductions claimed by the sponsors will be recovered by IRAS and the IPCs may be liable for penalties imposed by the Commissioner of Charities.\n\nEnquiries\n\nFor enquiries or clarification on this e-Tax Guide, please contact:\n\nTel: 6351 3763\nEmail: charities@iras.gov.sg\n\nAnnex A \u2013 Details of the three criteria under paragraph 5.2 and examples of non-qualifying donations\n\na) The donation must fall within one of the categories of donation specified in section 37(3)(c), (e) and (f) of the ITA.\n\nQualified Recipients\n\u2022 IPC\n\u2022 Singapore Government\n\u2022 Grant-making Philanthropic Organisation (registered by the Comptroller of Income Tax)\n\nTypes of Donations\nCash\nShares and units in unit trusts donated by any individual\n- Shares must be of a company listed on Singapore Exchange\n- Units in unit trust must be traded in Singapore or listed on the Singapore Exchange\nImmovable property\n\nDonations-in-kind do not constitute tax deductible donations except as provided under S37(3)(b), S37(3)(e) and S37(3)(f) of the ITA.\n\nExamples of non-qualifying donations:\n\nExample 1\nA florist donates its inventory of plants and flowers to an IPC to be used at a fund-raising event. As the donated items do not fall within the above list, they do not qualify as tax deductible donations.\n\nExample 2\nUnder a deed of arrangement, an IPC is allowed to use a piece of land for 50 years with no premium or rent payable to the landowner. This free use of land is not a tax deductible donation.\n\nb) The donation is a free-will gift for which the contributor relinquishes and confers all his rights, control and ownership over the gift to a qualified recipient when the donation is made.\n\nExamples of non-qualifying donations:\n\nExample 3\nA company pledges or promises to give $500,000 to an IPC. The pledge or promise itself does not constitute a donation since no money is transferred to the IPC yet. A donation is made only when the company honours the pledge by transferring the money to the IPC.\n\nContributions with a refund clause\n\nExample 4\nA company gives $1 million to an IPC with the condition that the amount, wholly or in part, be refunded to them if the amount was not utilised by the IPC for the agreed objective. While Regulation 11(7) of the IPC Regulations requires an IPC to return the donated funds if it was not utilised for the intended objectives, the inclusion of a refund clause creates a contractual obligation which is commercial in nature. Such a contribution agreement would be classified as a sponsorship and cannot qualify as a tax deductible donation.\n\nOn the other hand, if the IPC states in the agreement that it commits to adhere to all relevant laws, rules and legislations, including but not limited to Regulation 11(7) of the IPC Regulations, this clause itself does not constitute a refund clause and this factor alone will not disqualify the contribution as a tax deductible donation.\n\nExample 5\nA company gives $20 million to an IPC with the condition that the amount, wholly or in part, be refunded to them if: (a) IRAS determines that the $20 million does not qualify for enhanced tax deduction, or (b) certain benefits which were agreed upon were not given to the company. As the gift is subject to refund conditions, the $20 million cannot qualify as a tax deductible donation.\n\nContributions with an exclusivity clause\n\nExample 6\nA company gives $500,000 to an IPC on the condition that the IPC cannot enter into an agreement with another company for any form of sponsorship. As the gift imposes an exclusivity condition on the IPC, it is not an outright donation and does not qualify as a tax deductible donation. This is a sponsorship arrangement.\n\nContribution is a commercial arrangement in substance\n\nA pure gift of money or asset cannot be treated as a tax deductible donation if it forms a prerequisite for a subsequent commercial collaboration with the contributor or any person connected to the contributor, or if it is associated with any business arrangement involving the acquisition of goods or services by the IPC from the contributor or any person connected to the contributor. The entire arrangement constitutes a business arrangement or sponsorship, rather than a donation.\n\nExample 7\nIn return for a cash payment of $300,000 over a time period from a gaming software distributor, a university allows the distributor to advertise its gaming software at the school compound during its freshmen orientation week. The advertisements take the forms of setting up booths and displaying of distributor\u2019s banners, products and other collaterals at the school. If the university does not fulfil this obligation, the gaming software distributor will terminate any outstanding payments. Such a cash payment does not qualify as a tax deductible donation as the substance of the arrangement is that of commercial transaction and it is not a free-will gift. The sum of $300,000 should be more appropriately classified as a sponsorship.\n\nExample 8\nA production company makes a cash gift to an IPC and in return for the contribution, is awarded with exclusive rights to either produce or collaborate with the IPC to produce new media, arts performance, film, etc. Where the exclusive rights are contingent on the cash gift made, the cash gift then forms part of a business arrangement or sponsorship and is not a tax deductible donation.\n\nExample 9\nA company makes a contribution of $500,000 to an IPC. In return for the contribution, the company is provided with many marketing, publicity, and promotional benefits, but these benefits are valued at $100,000. The company is entitled to receive some other form of compensation if these benefits are not delivered fully. The entire contribution does not qualify as a tax deductible donation as the overall facts of the case indicate that the transaction is commercial in nature. The contribution is therefore a form of sponsorship.\n\nExample 10\nA company makes a contribution of $50,000 to an IPC to set up a scholarship. As part of the conditions for receiving the scholarship, the recipient is required to provide a list of services for the company. The contribution is substantially a commercial transaction similar to a service contract. The contribution is therefore a sponsorship.\n\nExample of qualifying donation:\n\nExample 11\nA company makes a contribution of $500,000 to an IPC. In return for the contribution, the company is given free tickets to a performance staged by the IPC. The IPC is not restricted from accepting contributions from other donors or acknowledging contributions made by other companies in the same sector/industry. The IPC prints all its donors\u2019 logos in its publicity banners and pamphlets as a form of acknowledgement. The company is not entitled to any refund of the contribution even if the IPC does not deliver any of the benefits it had earlier agreed to provide (e.g. there are no contractual clauses that indicate any refunds or compensations to be made to the company in the event that the performance is cancelled). The contribution qualifies as a tax deductible donation. While the company receives benefits in the form of free tickets for the performance, these benefits are treated as having no commercial value under the concessionary tax treatment. \n\nc) The donation is an outright gift or if the donation is subject to any condition specified by the donor as to the purpose for which the donation may be applied, all the three requirements under section 37(3C) of the ITA must be satisfied.\n\nThe following two types of donations to an IPC \u2013 an outright donation and a donation for a specified purpose are qualifying donations.\n\nOutright donation\nAn outright donation is an unconditional gift where the donor fully transfers both the ownership and control over the use of the donation to the IPC without stating any specified purpose as to how the donation should be used.\n\nDonations for specified purposes\nA donor may place legally enforceable conditions on how the IPC can use donation made. Such donations are tax deductible if (and only if) all the three requirements under section 37(3C) of the ITA are satisfied:\n(a) Each specified purpose must be one that advances an objective of the recipient set out in its governing instrument;\n(b) None of the specified purposes must be to advance the interests (whether directly or indirectly) of a particular race, belief or religion, or of a particular person or persons; and\n(c) The donor did not specify or imply in any manner that any part of the property or money that cannot be used for any of the specified purposes shall revert to him or be given to any other person.\n\nExample of non-qualifying donation:\n\nExample 12\nA family donates monies to an IPC on the condition that the IPC awards a scholarship under its education support program to a specified relative or person. As one of the specified purpose is to advance the interest of a particular person, it does not satisfy section 37(3C)(b) of the ITA. This donation is thus not tax deductible.\n\nExample of qualifying donation:\n\nExample 13\nAn individual makes a cash donation to a hospital (which is an IPC) and stipulates that the monies be applied only to senior citizens above the age of 70 years old for their medical needs. In this example, the condition imposed by the donor advances the charitable objects of the hospital. The condition also does not favour any named persons or a group of people based on race, belief or religion. The beneficiaries of the donation are a class of persons, and not \u201cparticular persons\u201d who are specified to receive the benefits; and thus the donation does not breach condition (b). Hence, this donation for a specified purpose is tax deductible as it meets all the requirements under section 37(3C) of the ITA.",
        "summary": "**Summary of Guidance on Tax Deductible Donations (e-Tax Guide)**\n\nThis e-Tax Guide provides essential information regarding tax-deductible donations made to Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) and Grant-Making Philanthropic Organisations (Grant-makers) under the Income Tax Act 1947 (ITA). It distinguishes between donations and sponsorships, outlining the criteria for tax deductibility.\n\n### Key Definitions:\n- **Institution of A Public Character (IPC)**: A registered or exempt charity in Singapore approved as an IPC.\n- **Grant-Making Philanthropic Organisation**: An organisation registered with IRAS under specific regulations.\n\n### Tax Deductible Donations:\n1. **Enhanced Tax Deductions**: The government offers enhanced tax deductions for donations to IPCs, requiring IPCs to issue tax deduction receipts for qualifying contributions.\n2. **Criteria for Tax Deductibility**:\n   - The contribution must fall under specified categories in the ITA.\n   - It must be a free-will gift where the donor relinquishes all rights to the IPC.\n   - If subject to conditions, it must meet all requirements of section 37(3C) of the ITA.\n\n### Non-Qualifying Contributions:\nContributions are not considered tax-deductible donations if they:\n- Include a refund clause.\n- Contain an exclusivity clause.\n- Are part of a commercial arrangement or exchange for benefits.\n\n### Refund Clause vs. Statutory Obligation:\nA statutory obligation to refund (e.g., if the IPC cannot use the funds as intended) does not disqualify a contribution as a donation. However, a contractual refund clause does.\n\n### Donations with Benefits:\nIf a donor receives benefits in return for a donation, the enhanced tax deduction applies only to the amount exceeding the value of the benefits. Certain benefits may be treated as having no commercial value under specific concessions.\n\n### Sponsorships:\n- Defined as arrangements providing benefits to the sponsor in exchange for contributions, sponsorships are not eligible for enhanced tax deductions.\n- However, sponsorship expenses may be claimed as business expenses if they meet the criteria of being incurred wholly and exclusively for income production.\n\n### Examples of Qualifying and Non-Qualifying Donations:\n- **Qualifying Donation**: A company donates $500,000 to an IPC and receives free tickets to an event, with no conditions on refunds or exclusivity.\n- **Non-Qualifying Donation**: A company pledges $1 million with a refund clause if the funds are not used as agreed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIPCs must carefully assess contributions to determine if they qualify as tax-deductible donations or sponsorships, ensuring compliance with the ITA. Misclassification can lead to penalties and recovery of tax deductions by IRAS.\n\nFor further inquiries, contact IRAS via phone or email provided in the guide.",

However, where the donor receives a benefit in return for the donation made, the tax deduction is only granted on the difference between the donation and the cost of benefit.\n\n2.2 Similarly, for GST purpose, a donation is not subject to GST where the recipient of donation does not provide any benefit to the donor in return for the donation. Where the recipient of donation provides some benefits to the donor in return for a donation, all or part of the donation is considered to be payment in return for goods or services. GST is to be accounted by the recipient of donation on such consideration if the recipient of donation is GST-registered.\n\n3 Concessionary Tax Treatment \u2013 Donations With Certain Benefits\n\n3.1 IRAS has reviewed the tax treatment of donations with benefits. To further encourage philanthropic giving, as a concession, certain donations made to registered charities and institutions of a public character (IPCs) will be deemed to be pure donations notwithstanding there is a benefit given in return for the donation. To qualify for the concessionary tax treatment, donations with benefits given in return will be regarded as pure donations if the benefits are treated as having no commercial value. Benefits are treated as having no commercial value if the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) the benefit is given in acknowledgement of the donation; and\n\n(b) the benefit has no resale value\n\n3.2 The table below lists the common benefits given in return for donations, wherein IRAS will now deem the donations as pure donations for which the concessionary tax treatment is applicable.\n\nTypes of Benefits\n\nWhether Benefit is Considered to have a Commercial Value\n\nNo\n\nCharity dinners where the donation includes ticket to attend dinner\n\nIncome Tax Treatment\n\nGST Treatment\n\nTax deduction on the full amount donated is allowed to the donor.\n\nNo GST needs to be accounted by the recipient of donation.\n\nTax deduction on the full amount donated is allowed to the donor.\n\nNo GST needs to be accounted by the recipient of donation.\n\nTax deduction on the full amount donated is allowed to the donor.\n\nNo GST needs to be accounted by the recipient of donation.\n\nTax deduction on the full amount donated is allowed to the donor.\n\nNo GST needs to be accounted by the recipient of donation.\n\nWhere the souvenirs or gifts are commercially available, tax deduction on the difference between the amount donated and the price of the souvenir or gift is allowed to the donor.\n\nWhere the souvenirs or gifts are commercially available, GST is to be accounted by the recipient of donation on the price of the souvenir or gift.\n\nCharity shows where the donation includes ticket to attend show\n\nComplimentary tickets (e.g. entry to Singapore Zoo)\n\nGolf tournament where donation includes golf game for donor\n\nSouvenir or gift (e.g. plaques, commemorative books, CDs, goodie bags, etc)\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo, except where such souvenir or gift is sold commercially. The souvenir or gift will not be considered as sold commercially if it: (a) is specially made for a particular fund-raising event and not available for sale in the market; (b) bears the logo of the fund-raiser or; (c) carries the fund-raising message.\n\n3.3 For all other benefits given in return for donation, the current tax treatment of disallowing income tax deduction and imposing GST on the benefit accruing to the donor continues to be applicable. The table below lists some of these benefits given in return for donations, and illustrates the current tax treatment for the circumstances.\n\nTypes of Benefits\n\nWhether Benefit is Considered to have a Commercial Value\n\nAdvertising space\n\nYes\n\nCharity auction\n\nYes\n\nIncome Tax Treatment\n\nGST Treatment\n\nTax deduction on the difference between the amount donated and the price of the advertising space is allowed to the donor.\n\nGST is to be accounted by the recipient of donation on the price of the advertising space.\n\nTax deduction on the difference between the amount donated and the market value of the item being auctioned is allowed to the donor.\n\nGST is to be accounted by the recipient of donation on the market value of the auctioned item.\n\nLucky draws\n\nYes\n\nNo tax deduction on any amount donated is allowed to the donor.\n\nWhere the payout from lucky draws is in the form of cash, GST is to be accounted by the recipient of donation on the gross donations received less cash payout.\n\nWhere the payout from lucky draws is in the form of goods or services, GST is to be accounted by the recipient of donation on the gross donations received.\n\nSales of artefact\n\nYes\n\nTax deduction on the difference between the amount donated and the market value of the artefact is allowed to the donor.\n\nGST is to be accounted by the recipient of donation on the market value of the artefact.\n\n3.4 The concessionary tax treatment prescribed under paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 will apply to qualifying donations made on or after 1 May 2006 to registered charities and IPCs. IRAS will update the lists regularly to provide clarity and certainty to registered charities and IPCs and support their fund raising activities.\n\n4 Enquiries\n\n4.1 For enquiries or clarification on this Guide, please call 6351 3763 or email to charities@iras.gov.sg.",
        "summary": "The e-Tax Guide published by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) outlines the tax treatment for donations made before 19 March 2021, particularly focusing on donations that come with benefits. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Tax Deductions**: Under Section 37(3) of the Income Tax Act, donors can claim a double tax deduction for certain donations. However, if a donor receives benefits in return, the deduction is limited to the difference between the donation amount and the cost of the benefit received.\n\n2. **GST Implications**: Donations are not subject to Goods and Services Tax (GST) if no benefits are provided in return. If benefits are provided, the donation may be partially considered a payment for goods or services, and GST must be accounted for by the recipient if they are GST-registered.\n\n3. **Concessionary Tax Treatment**: To encourage donations, IRAS allows certain donations with benefits to be treated as \"pure donations,\" meaning the full donation amount can be deducted, provided the benefits have no commercial value. Conditions for this include:\n   - The benefit is given in acknowledgment of the donation.\n   - The benefit has no resale value.\n\n4. **Examples of Benefits**: \n   - Benefits like tickets to charity dinners, shows, or complimentary entries (e.g., to the Singapore Zoo) are considered to have no commercial value, allowing full tax deductions and no GST.\n   - Souvenirs or gifts that are commercially available will only allow deductions on the difference between the donation and the item's price, and GST must be accounted for.\n\n5. **Commercially Valuable Benefits**: Benefits such as advertising space, charity auctions, and lucky draws are considered to have commercial value, limiting tax deductions and requiring GST to be accounted for based on the market value of the benefits.\n\n6. **Effective Date**: The concessionary tax treatment applies to qualifying donations made on or after 1 May 2006 to registered charities and institutions of a public character (IPCs).\n\nFor further inquiries, individuals can contact IRAS directly.",

        "text": "Tax Treatment of Donations with Benefits\n\nThis e-Tax Guide sets out the concessionary tax treatment applicable for cash donations with certain types of benefits received in return, where the donations are made on or after 19 March 2021. This guide is only applicable for donations, a voluntary gift where the donor\u2019s contribution is not motivated by a benefit-in-return.\n\nThis e-Tax Guide will be relevant to you if you are an Institution of a Public Character (IPC) or a registered charity.\n\nWhen a donor receives a benefit in return for the donation made to an IPC, a 2.5 times tax deduction is granted only on the difference between the donation and the value of the benefit, and GST is to be accounted for by the recipient of the donation. However, IRAS applies an administrative concession to certain benefits that are given out in connection with a fundraising activity and are deemed to have no commercial value. As a result, the donor receives a 2.5 times tax deduction on the full amount of his donation, and the recipient of the donation does not have to account for GST on the benefit given.\n\nThis list of benefits is exhaustive; the concession does not apply to benefits outside of this list. Some common benefits that are not eligible for the concessionary tax treatment are laid out in the guide. An outright sale of goods and services is not regarded as a bona fide donation. Consequently, the 2.5 times tax deduction would not be allowed for such transactions for income tax purposes. Similarly, GST is to be accounted for on the total consideration received for the sale of goods or services.\n\nIPCs are to note the above tax treatment in conducting their fundraising activities.\n\nAn Institution of a Public Character (IPC) is a registered charity or an exempt charity in Singapore that is approved as an institution of a public character under the Charities Act on the application of the charity or which is deemed as an institution of a public character under any written law. A registered charity is a charity registered with the Commissioner of Charities under section 5 of the Charities Act. The recipient of a donation refers to both IPCs and registered charities.\n\nIPCs and registered charities may organize different types of fundraising activities. Examples include charity golf games, gala dinners, or charity shows. Typically, donors who made donations of certain amounts will be entitled to participate in these activities and may also receive other benefits such as souvenirs, meals, or entertainment in the course of these events.\n\nUnder section 37(3) of the Income Tax Act, a tax deduction at 2.5 times of the donation amount is granted in respect of cash donations to IPCs. However, where the donor receives a benefit in return for the donation made, the tax deduction is only granted on the difference between the donation and the value of the benefit.\n\nSimilarly, for GST purposes, a donation is not subject to GST where the recipient of the donation does not provide any benefit to the donor in return for the donation. Where the recipient of the donation provides some benefits to the donor in return for a donation, all or part of the donation is considered as payment in return for goods or services. GST is to be accounted for by the recipient of the donation on such consideration if the recipient of the donation is GST-registered.\n\nTo support philanthropic giving and to ease compliance, IRAS has been applying an administrative concession to donations with benefits since 2006. Under the concession, IRAS deems certain donations with benefits received in return as pure donations, provided the benefits given fall within a specified list of benefits. Such benefits specified in the list are treated as having no commercial value. The donor will enjoy a tax deduction on the full amount of cash donations, and no GST needs to be accounted for by the recipient either. IRAS has reviewed this administrative concession and is updating the concessionary tax treatment with effect from 19 March 2021 after consultation with IPCs, sector administrators, and the Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth (MCCY).\n\nTo qualify for the concessionary tax treatment, donations with benefits given in return will be regarded as pure donations if the benefits are treated as having no commercial value. To be treated as having no commercial value, the benefits must be given out in connection with a fundraising activity and fall within the list of benefits specified in the guide.\n\nWhere the benefit given falls outside the specified list, the tax deduction will be granted after netting off the market value of the benefits. GST will also have to be accounted for on the market value of the benefits.\n\nThe table lists the common benefits given in return for donations, wherein IRAS will deem the donations as pure donations for which the concessionary tax treatment is applicable. \n\nExamples of benefits that qualify for concession include charity gala dinners, charity shows, golf tournaments, not-intended-for-resale complimentary tickets, and souvenirs or gifts. Tax deduction on the full amount donated is allowed to the donor, and no GST needs to be accounted for by the recipient of the donation.\n\nIncidental benefits refer to benefits that are given as part and parcel of a fundraising event and are not intended for resale. Not-intended-for-resale refers to items that fulfill certain conditions, such as having an indication that it is \u201cnot-for-sale\u201d or not being in a form or packaging that is typically sold commercially.\n\nFor lucky draws held as part of a fundraising event, if the top prize is at or under the $2,000 threshold, the donor will enjoy a tax deduction on the full donation, and no GST needs to be accounted for on the lucky draw. However, if the value of the top prize exceeds $2,000, the administrative concession will not apply, and no tax deduction will be allowed on any amount donated.\n\nFor fundraising events that fall outside the specified categories, the concessionary treatment will generally not apply. Under such a scenario, no income tax deduction will be given on the donation, and GST has to be accounted for on the market value of all benefits given in the fundraising event, including the lucky draw prizes.\n\nFor standalone lucky draws, contributions that give donors a right to participate are regarded as payments made in return for the chance to participate and win prizes in the lucky draws. As they are not pure donations, no tax deduction will be allowed on any amount donated.\n\nFor all other benefits given in return for donations, the current tax treatment of allowing tax deduction on the difference between the donation and the value of the benefits given, as well as imposing GST on the Open Market Value of the benefits accruing to the donor, continues to be applicable.\n\nAn IPC or registered charity that merely acknowledges a donor for its donations will not be considered as having conferred a benefit to the donor. IRAS will consider an acknowledgement as such if all of the following conditions are satisfied: the acknowledgement is a display of the donor\u2019s logo and/or name on the IPCs\u2019 or charities\u2019 collaterals, accompanied with specific wording, and there are no comparative or qualitative descriptions or links to the donor\u2019s website.\n\nWhere necessary, the market value/price of the benefits may be determined using various methods, including retail price, comparable benefits, expert opinion, or cost to the IPC/registered charity for providing the benefit.\n\nFor enquiries or clarification on this e-Tax Guide, please contact the relevant departments at IRAS. \n\nAnnex A provides a table illustrating tax treatment with lucky draws held as part of a fundraising event, while Annex B contains frequently asked questions regarding various scenarios related to donations and benefits.",
        "summary": "**Summary of Tax Treatment of Donations with Benefits (Effective from 19 March 2021)**\n\nThis e-Tax Guide outlines the tax treatment for cash donations made to Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) or registered charities in Singapore, particularly when benefits are received in return for the donation. Key points include:\n\n1. **Tax Deduction**: Donors are eligible for a 2.5 times tax deduction on cash donations to IPCs. If a benefit is received, the deduction applies only to the difference between the donation amount and the value of the benefit.\n\n2. **GST Implications**: Donations are not subject to Goods and Services Tax (GST) if no benefits are provided. If benefits are given, GST must be accounted for on the total consideration received if the recipient is GST-registered.\n\n3. **Administrative Concession**: Since 2006, IRAS has allowed certain benefits deemed to have no commercial value to be treated as pure donations. This means donors can receive a full tax deduction and the recipient does not need to account for GST. This concession has been updated as of 19 March 2021.\n\n4. **Qualifying Benefits**: Benefits must fall within a specified list to qualify for the concession. Common qualifying benefits include tickets to charity events, souvenirs, and meals. Benefits not on the list will result in tax deductions being calculated after deducting the market value of the benefits.\n\n5. **Lucky Draws**: For lucky draws associated with fundraising, if the top prize is valued at or below $2,000, the donor can receive a full tax deduction. If the prize exceeds $2,000, the concession does not apply, and no tax deduction is allowed.\n\n6. **Standalone Lucky Draws**: Contributions for standalone lucky draws are treated as payments for a chance to win, not as donations, and thus do not qualify for tax deductions.\n\n7. **Acknowledgements**: Merely acknowledging a donor does not constitute a benefit. Acknowledgements must meet specific criteria to be considered non-beneficial.\n\n8. **Market Value Determination**: The market value of benefits can be assessed using various methods, including retail price or expert opinion.\n\nFor further inquiries, donors and IPCs can contact the relevant departments at IRAS. Additional resources, including a table of tax treatment for lucky draws and FAQs, are provided in the annexes of the guide.",

        "text": "Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework: Frequently Asked Questions\n\nThe OECD maintains and regularly updates a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) on the application of the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The questions set out in these FAQs were received from business and government delegates. The answers to such questions clarify the CARF and help to ensure consistency in their implementation.\n\nSECTION I: OBLIGATIONS OF REPORTING CRYPTO-ASSET SERVICE PROVIDERS\n\n1. Branch nexus\n\nIf a Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider is subject to the reporting and due diligence requirements in Sections II and III in a Jurisdiction pursuant to Section I(A)(4) by virtue of having a Branch that is a regular place of business in that jurisdiction and the Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider does not have a higher nexus to another jurisdiction that has implemented CARF, should the Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider complete the reporting and due diligence requirements in that Jurisdiction with respect to Relevant Transactions effectuated by the Branch only or with respect to all Relevant Transactions effectuated by the Entity?\n\nBecause the highest nexus that the Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider has to a jurisdiction that has implemented CARF is a regular place of business through a Branch, the Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider should complete the reporting and due diligence requirements in the Jurisdiction with respect to all Relevant Transactions effectuated by the Entity, not only those effectuated by the Branch, unless the Entity has another Branch in a jurisdiction that has implemented CARF and Sections I(G) or (H) are applicable.\n\nSECTION II: REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Reporting requirements with respect to Reportable Retail Payment Transactions\n\nWhat are the reporting requirements with respect to Reportable Retail Payment Transactions?\n\nWhere a Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider transfers payments made in Relevant Crypto-Assets from a customer to the merchant for a value greater than USD 50,000 as an agent for the customer, the Reportable Crypto-Asset Service Provider should report such Transfer as a Reportable Retail Payment Transaction.\n\nIf the Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider is acting as an agent of the merchant, the Transfer is reported as such and not as a Reportable Retail Payment Transaction. However, with respect to such Transfers, if the Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider is required to verify the identity of the merchant\u2019s customer pursuant to domestic anti-money laundering rules, then the Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider is required to also treat the customer of the merchant as the Crypto-Asset User and to report the transaction as a Reportable Retail Payment Transaction with respect to the customer.\n\nIn terms of reporting requirements, aggregate information on Transfers that constitute Reportable Retail Payment Transactions with respect to a particular Crypto-Asset User is required to be reported as a separate category of Relevant Transactions. Aggregate information with respect to Transfers that do not constitute Reportable Retail Payment Transactions solely by virtue of not meeting the de minimis threshold should be included in the aggregate information reported with respect to Transfers, and not as Reportable Retail Payment Transactions.\n\nSECTION III: DUE DILIGENCE PROCEDURES\n\n1. Reportable Jurisdiction Person with no tax residence\n\nWith respect to an Entity Crypto-Asset User that is a partnership, limited liability partnership or similar legal arrangement without residence for tax purposes, can a Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider rely on the address of the principal office of the Entity for purposes of determining what jurisdiction such Entity is resident in for purposes of the CARF?\n\nYes, to the extent the Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider has no other documentation available to determine the place of effective management of the Entity Crypto-Asset User, the Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider may rely on the address of the principal office of the Entity for purposes of determining what jurisdiction such Entity is resident in for purposes of the CARF.\n\nSECTION IV: DEFINED TERMS\n\n1. Non-custodial services\n\nDoes the definition of Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider provided for in Section IV(B)(1) exclude non-custodial services effectuating Exchange Transactions?\n\nNo. Pursuant to Section IV(B)(1), a Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider means \u201cany individual or Entity that, as a business, provides a service effectuating Exchange Transactions for or on behalf of customers, including [\u2026] by making available a trading platform\u201d. For that purpose, a trading platform may be made available by an individual or Entity with or without offering custodial services.\n\n2. Wrapping and liquid staking\n\nCertain Relevant Transactions involve the exchange of Relevant Crypto-Assets for a token representing the exchanged Relevant Crypto-Assets. This includes instances where a Relevant Crypto-Asset on one blockchain represents a Relevant Crypto-Asset from another blockchain or the creation of a Relevant Crypto-Asset on the same blockchain that can be used in an automatically executing transaction that the original Relevant Crypto-Asset cannot be used in. The new Relevant Crypto-Asset is supposed to match the asset value it is representing, and it can normally be redeemed at any time.\n\nSimilarly, a Crypto-Asset User may transfer Relevant Crypto-Assets into an automatically executing contract for the purpose of being used as part of a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to validate transactions on a distributed ledger. In exchange, the Crypto-Asset User may then be issued a tokenised version of their Relevant Crypto-Assets, which carries the same value and is transferable or tradable.\n\nAre such transactions, as described above, Exchange Transactions?\n\nYes, because they involve the exchange of a Relevant Crypto-Asset for another Relevant Crypto-Asset they constitute Exchange Transactions. This is irrespective of whether an Exchange Transaction gives rise to a taxable disposition under applicable tax rules.\n\n3. Collateralised loans\n\nShould a Relevant Transaction where Relevant Crypto-Assets are transferred as collateral in exchange for a transaction denominated as a loan of Relevant Crypto-Assets or Fiat Currency, and whereby the terms of the agreement require the return of the collateral and the borrowed Relevant Crypto-Assets or Fiat Currency, be reported as an Exchange Transaction or as a Transfer?\n\nA Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider must only treat a Relevant Transaction as an Exchange Transaction if, based on its available knowledge at the time of the Relevant Transaction, it can determine that the transaction consists of an acquisition or disposal of one or more Relevant Crypto-Assets as compensation for Fiat Currency or other Relevant Crypto-Assets. Where Relevant Crypto-Assets are transferred as a loan or as collateral, they are not transferred as compensation for the acquisition of other Relevant Crypto-Assets. Therefore, in those instances, or where the Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider does not have knowledge about the characteristics of the Relevant Transaction, it must report it as a Transfer.\n\nWhere a Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Provider has knowledge that the Relevant Transactions it is effectuating consists of a transfer of Relevant Crypto-Assets as collateral in exchange for a loan of Relevant Crypto-Assets, which Transfer types should it use for reporting such transactions over the lifetime of the loan?\n\nBoth the Transfers effectuated for the borrowing and the return of the borrowed Relevant Crypto-Assets must be reported as Transfer type \u201cCrypto loan\u201d. The transfer of Relevant Crypto-Assets in connection with the deposit and return of the collateral must be reported as Transfer type \u201cCollateral\u201d. If, separately from the return of the borrowed Relevant Crypto-Assets, an amount of Relevant Crypto-Assets is transferred to the lender by way of compensation for the loan, such Transfer must be reported as Transfer type \u201cOther\u201d.",
        "summary": "**Summary of the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) FAQs**\n\nThe OECD's Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) outlines the obligations and reporting requirements for Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) regarding crypto-asset transactions. Here are the key points:\n\n### Section I: Obligations of Reporting CASPs\n- **Branch Nexus**: If a CASP has a branch in a jurisdiction that has implemented CARF, it must report all Relevant Transactions of the entity, not just those from the branch, unless another branch in a different CARF jurisdiction applies.\n\n### Section II: Reporting Requirements\n- **Reportable Retail Payment Transactions**: CASPs must report transactions over USD 50,000 as Reportable Retail Payment Transactions. If acting as an agent for the merchant and required to verify the merchant\u2019s customer identity, the CASP must report the transaction as a Reportable Retail Payment Transaction for that customer.\n- **Aggregate Reporting**: Information on transfers that do not meet the de minimis threshold should be reported in aggregate, not as separate Reportable Retail Payment Transactions.\n\n### Section III: Due Diligence Procedures\n- **Tax Residence of Entities**: For partnerships or similar entities without a tax residence, CASPs can use the address of the principal office to determine the jurisdiction of residence for CARF purposes.\n\n### Section IV: Defined Terms\n- **Non-Custodial Services**: The definition of CASP includes those providing exchange transaction services, regardless of whether they offer custodial services.\n- **Exchange Transactions**: Transactions involving the exchange of crypto-assets, such as wrapping or liquid staking, are considered Exchange Transactions, regardless of tax implications.\n- **Collateralized Loans**: Transfers of crypto-assets as collateral for loans should be reported as Transfers, not Exchange Transactions, unless they involve the acquisition or disposal of crypto-assets. Reporting must differentiate between collateral transfers and loan transactions.\n\n### Reporting Types for Loans\n- **Crypto Loans**: Transfers for borrowing and returning crypto-assets must be reported as \"Crypto loan.\" Collateral transfers should be reported as \"Collateral,\" and any compensation for the loan as \"Other.\"\n\nThis framework aims to standardize reporting and ensure compliance with tax obligations related to crypto-assets across jurisdictions.",

The number of arbitrators shall be one.\n\nThis Step-by-Step Guide is intended to facilitate further commitments by jurisdictions to implement the CARF to ensure its widespread implementation, as well as to help support the implementation of the CARF thereafter, by raising the awareness of jurisdictions and the private sector in relation to what making such a commitment entails and the steps that must be taken in order to implement the CARF on a consistent basis and in accordance with the requirements.\n\nAlthough each jurisdiction\u2019s specific approach will vary depending on its own unique circumstances, implementing the CARF involves several key building blocks that jurisdictions will need to consistently put in place. Such consistency in approach to CARF implementation is needed to ensure a level playing field across jurisdictions, minimise the reporting and information exchange burden for both the obliged service providers under the CARF (i.e. Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers (RCASPs)) as well as tax authorities, and, crucially, optimise the effective use of the CARF information exchanged. Specifically, the CARF building blocks involve jurisdictions:\n\n\u2022 making a political commitment to conduct CARF exchanges from a specified date;\n\u2022 adopting an administrative and Information Technology (IT) framework to ensure compliance and support the exchanges operationally;\n\u2022 implementing legal frameworks covering both domestic and international aspects; and\n\u2022 ensuring appropriate confidentiality safeguards are in place.\n\nFurthermore, private sector actors will need to invest resources to understand, plan for and carry out their obligations to jurisdictions that have implemented the CARF. The steps they will need to carry out include:\n\n\u2022 determining whether the private sector actor is a RCASP;\n\u2022 determining which jurisdictions the RCASP has a nexus to under the rules implemented by the jurisdictions consistent with the CARF, and, therefore, which jurisdiction the RCASP will report to;\n\u2022 understanding the due diligence and reporting obligations in the reporting jurisdiction and the procedures and systems that will be needed to fulfil them; and\n\u2022 implementing the requirements to ensure the effective implementation of the customer due diligence and reporting obligations.\n\nFor jurisdictions and Financial Institutions that have implemented the CRS, which provides for AEOI in relation to Financial Accounts, many of these steps are familiar. As will be outlined throughout this document, the approaches to implement these building blocks can often build directly on the approaches used to implement the CRS.\n\nThis document is therefore intended to provide a starting point for governmental authorities and relevant private sector actors to understand each of these aspects in relation to the implementation of the CARF. The objective is to thereby ensure that all stakeholders are informed about what implementing the CARF entails, as well as to support a harmonised approach with respect to its implementation. Note that this document is not intended to interpret, add to, or alter the CARF and is without prejudice to a jurisdiction\u2019s domestic implementing legislation or rules consistent with the CARF. In the event that there is any discrepancy or lack of clarity regarding the contents of this document and the CARF, the CARF shall prevail. Furthermore, RCASPs should not rely on the contents of this document to satisfy themselves that they are complying with the requirements of the CARF. Instead, RCASPs must refer to the implementation of the requirements in the jurisdiction(s) in which they are subject to due diligence and reporting obligations, in order to ensure the requirements are complied with in that jurisdiction.\n\nThe CARF provides for AEOI in relation to Crypto-Assets. The CARF defines \u201cCrypto-Assets\u201d as \u201ca digital representation of value that relies on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or a similar technology to validate and secure transactions\", which includes cryptocurrencies, as well as cryptography-based tokens. This definition is intentionally broad, as the market for Crypto-Assets continues to develop rapidly. Recent years have witnessed increasing popularity, transactions in and the value of a number of Crypto-Asset types, attracting professional investors, as well as individuals, to the sector. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, Crypto-Assets rely on new technologies (i.e. cryptography and distributed ledger technology) that allow for the issuing, recording, transferring and storing of Crypto-Assets in a decentralised manner, without the need to rely on traditional financial intermediaries or a centralised administrator (e.g. a central bank or government authority). Crypto-Assets can also be used to make payments for goods and services, again without the need to rely on traditional financial intermediaries. Many users are attracted by the decentralised nature of Crypto-Assets, which can allow for them to be sent across national borders faster, more cheaply and more easily than traditional currency issued by governments and financial assets and offer potentially novel forms of investment. The CARF is therefore designed to apply to such activities, in a similar way as the CRS applies to Financial Accounts.\n\nThe CARF therefore brings tax transparency to the Crypto-Asset sector which, once implemented, imposes obligations on a new subset of service providers, RCASPs, which are the service providers best positioned to collect and report information on transactions of Crypto-Assets. Specifically, the CARF requires RCASPs to identify their users and to report on specified transactions, with a view to ensuring the annualised reporting of tax relevant information concerning certain activities in relation to Crypto-Assets. Once received by tax authorities, the information will be automatically exchanged with the tax authorities of the jurisdiction(s) of residence of the Crypto-Asset Users, pursuant to an international agreements that provides a legal basis for the automatic exchange of information for tax purposes.\n\nWhile the CARF is considered to be an \u201cintegral part\u201d of the international standards for AEOI, which also includes the CRS, it is a standalone framework from the CRS and other forms of AEOI as it applies to the Crypto-Asset sector. Nevertheless, the CARF shares several features with the CRS that are relevant for tax administrations and service providers to understand possible approaches to implementation. These similarities include the annualised reporting and exchange of information, the due diligence procedures to be followed, as well as the IT and confidentiality requirements. It is therefore useful, as a starting point, to review the similarities and differences between the CARF and the CRS.\n\nThe remainder of this document has three Chapters: the first focuses on the legal frameworks that jurisdictions must put in place to implement the CARF, including to impose the due diligence and reporting obligations on RCASPs; the second focuses on the administrative and IT frameworks that need to be put in place by RCASPs and jurisdictions to implement the CARF; and the third describes the due diligence and reporting rules found in the CARF, to provide an initial high-level reference guide on the CARF rules.",
        "summary": "The \"Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding and Implementing the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF)\" outlines the framework approved by the CARF Group and adopted by the Global Forum to enhance tax transparency in the crypto-asset sector. The CARF aims to impose reporting obligations on Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers (RCASPs) to facilitate automatic exchange of information (AEOI) regarding crypto-assets among jurisdictions.\n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Implementation Requirements**: Jurisdictions must:\n   - Make a political commitment to conduct CARF exchanges.\n   - Establish administrative and IT frameworks for compliance.\n   - Implement legal frameworks for domestic and international aspects.\n   - Ensure confidentiality safeguards are in place.\n\n2. **Private Sector Obligations**: RCASPs need to:\n   - Determine their status as RCASPs.\n   - Identify jurisdictions where they have a reporting obligation.\n   - Understand due diligence and reporting requirements.\n   - Implement necessary systems for compliance.\n\n3. **Definition of Crypto-Assets**: The CARF defines crypto-assets broadly as digital representations of value secured by cryptographic technology, including cryptocurrencies and tokens.\n\n4. **Tax Transparency**: The CARF aims to bring tax transparency to the crypto-asset sector, requiring RCASPs to report user information and transactions to tax authorities, which will then exchange this information internationally.\n\n5. **Comparison with CRS**: While the CARF is a standalone framework, it shares similarities with the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) in terms of reporting, due diligence procedures, and IT requirements, making it easier for jurisdictions familiar with CRS to implement CARF.\n\n6. **Document Structure**: The guide consists of three chapters focusing on:\n   - Legal frameworks for imposing obligations on RCASPs.\n   - Administrative and IT frameworks for implementation.\n   - Due diligence and reporting rules under the CARF.\n\nThis guide serves as a resource for both governmental authorities and private sector actors to understand and implement the CARF effectively, ensuring a harmonized approach across jurisdictions.",

        "text": "Tax Treatment of Gains or Losses from the Sale of Foreign Assets\n\nThis e-Tax Guide explains the income tax treatment of gains or losses from the sale or disposal of any movable or immovable property situated outside Singapore, referred to as \u201cforeign asset.\u201d It is relevant to entities that derive gains or losses from the sale of foreign assets.\n\nCurrently, gains from the sale of foreign assets that are capital in nature are not taxable. To address international tax avoidance risks related to non-taxation of disposal gains in the absence of real economic activities, Singapore has amended its foreign-sourced income regime to subject foreign-sourced disposal gains to tax under specific circumstances. The amendment aligns with Singapore\u2019s focus on anchoring substantive economic activities in Singapore and its longstanding policy to align key areas of its tax regime with international norms.\n\nSingapore will treat gains from the sale or disposal of foreign assets as income chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1947 if the gains are not otherwise chargeable to tax under section 10(1) of the ITA or the gains are otherwise exempt from tax under the ITA. Such gains are referred to as \u201cforeign-sourced disposal gains.\u201d Foreign-sourced disposal gains will be chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(g) of the ITA when the gains are received in Singapore from outside Singapore by a covered entity and the covered entity that derived the gains does not have adequate economic substance in Singapore or the gains are derived from a disposal of foreign Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs).\n\nThe changes will apply to the sale or disposal of a foreign asset that occurs on or after 1 January 2024.\n\nPrior to 1 January 2024, Singapore taxes gains from the sale or disposal of assets as income when the gains are revenue in nature, regardless of whether the income is Singapore-sourced or foreign-sourced. Whether a gain from the sale or disposal of an asset is treated as capital or revenue in nature is determined with regard to the facts or circumstances of each case and with reference to established case law principles.\n\nApart from the above, Singapore does not tax gains from the sale or disposal of assets that are capital in nature, whether they are foreign-sourced or Singapore-sourced.\n\nUnder the new foreign-sourced disposal gains tax regime, foreign-sourced disposal gains received in Singapore by an entity of a relevant group from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset will be treated as income chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(g) of the ITA under certain circumstances. The foreign-sourced disposal gains will be subject to tax if the entity does not have adequate economic substance in Singapore or the gains are from the disposal of a foreign IPR, and the sale or disposal of the foreign asset occurs on or after 1 January 2024.\n\nFor example, if an entity disposes of a foreign asset on 1 June 2023, and the disposal gains are received in Singapore on 1 June 2024, such gains will not be subject to tax in Singapore. If the disposal of the foreign asset occurs on 1 June 2024, and the disposal gains are received in Singapore on 1 June 2025, the disposal gains will be subject to tax in Singapore in the year of assessment 2026, unless the gains from the disposal of the asset (not being a foreign IPR) are derived from or incidental to the business activities or operations of an entity mentioned or by an entity that is able to meet the economic substance requirement.\n\nThe foreign-sourced disposal gains are regarded as received in Singapore and chargeable to tax if such gains meet the conditions set out in section 10L(9) of the ITA, i.e., they are remitted to, or transmitted or brought into, Singapore; applied in or towards satisfaction of any debt incurred in respect of a trade or business carried on in Singapore; or applied to the purchase of any movable property which is brought into Singapore.\n\nGenerally, the foreign-sourced disposal gains are deemed to be received in Singapore only if such gains belong to an entity that is located in Singapore. Thus, foreign entities that are not incorporated, registered, or established in Singapore and are not operating in or from Singapore will not be within the scope of section 10L of the ITA.\n\nOnly entities of relevant groups (\u201ccovered entities\u201d) will be within the scope of section 10L of the ITA. An entity is a member of a group of entities if its assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and cash flows are included in the consolidated financial statements of the parent entity of the group or excluded from the consolidated financial statements of the parent entity of the group solely on size or materiality grounds or on the grounds that the entity is held for sale.\n\nA group is a relevant group if the entities of the group are not all incorporated, registered, or established in Singapore or any entity of the group has a place of business outside Singapore. The definition of a relevant group means that a group with only Singapore entities and operates only in Singapore will not fall within the scope of section 10L of the ITA. However, if one of the entities of the group has a place of business in a foreign jurisdiction, the group is considered a relevant group for the purpose of section 10L of the ITA.\n\nThe gains from the sale or disposal of any movable or immovable property situated outside Singapore (\u201ccovered income\u201d) of a covered entity will be subject to tax under section 10L of the ITA. Common examples where assets are determined to be situated outside Singapore include immovable property situated outside Singapore, equity securities and debt securities registered in a foreign exchange, unlisted shares issued by a company incorporated outside Singapore, loans where the creditor is a resident in a jurisdiction outside Singapore, and IPRs where the owner is a resident in a jurisdiction outside Singapore.\n\nSection 10L of the ITA will not apply to gains from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset (not being a foreign IPR) when it is carried out as part of, or incidental to, the business activities of certain licensed entities or carried out as part of, or incidental to, the business activities or operations of an entity which are incentivized under specific tax incentives in Singapore in the basis period in which the sale or disposal occurred or carried out by an entity that is able to meet the economic substance requirement in Singapore in the basis period in which the sale or disposal occurred.\n\nForeign-sourced disposal gains from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset will not be brought to tax if the entity has adequate economic substance in the basis period in which the sale or disposal occurs. The economic substance requirement will not be applied at a jurisdictional level for a group. It will be assessed at the entity level.\n\nA pure equity-holding entity is an entity whose function is to hold shares or equity interests in any other entity and has no income other than dividends or similar payments from the shares or equity interests, gains on the sale or disposal of the shares or equity interests, or income incidental to its activities of holding shares or equity interests. To meet the economic substance requirement, the entity is required to satisfy all the following conditions in the basis period in which the sale or disposal occurs: the entity submits to a public authority any return, statement, or account required under the written law under which it is incorporated or registered; the operations of the entity are managed and performed in Singapore; and the entity has adequate human resources and premises in Singapore to carry out the operations of the entity.\n\nA non-pure equity-holding entity is an entity that is not a pure equity-holding entity. The economic substance requirement will be determined based on an analysis of the entity\u2019s core income generating activities in Singapore. To meet the economic substance requirement, the entity is required to satisfy all the following conditions in the basis period in which the sale or disposal occurs: the operations of the entity are managed and performed in Singapore; and the entity has adequate economic substance in Singapore, taking into account the number of full-time employees of the entity, the qualifications and experience of such employees, the amount of business expenditure incurred by the entity in respect of its operations in Singapore, and whether the key business decisions of the entity are made by persons in Singapore.\n\nThe economic substance requirement takes into account outsourcing arrangements where an entity outsources some or all of its economic activities to third parties or group entities. For an outsourcing arrangement to satisfy the economic substance requirement, the economic activities are to be carried out by the outsourced entity in Singapore, the outsourcing entity has direct and effective control over the outsourced activities, and the outsourced entity providing the outsourced services must set aside dedicated resources to provide the outsourced services.\n\nThe tax treatment of gains from the sale or disposal of foreign IPRs is different from that of other foreign assets. The non-taxation of foreign-sourced disposal gains for entities is not applicable to gains from the disposal of foreign IPRs. For gains from the sale or disposal of qualifying foreign IPRs, a modified nexus approach is used to determine the extent of such gains that will not be taxable when received in Singapore. The modified nexus approach permits jurisdictions to provide tax benefits to the income arising out of a qualifying IPR, as long as there is a direct nexus between the income receiving benefits and expenditures contributing to that income.\n\nFor non-qualifying foreign IPRs, the full amount of the gains from the sale or disposal of the IPRs will be subject to tax when such gains are received in Singapore. The transitional nexus ratio allows an entity to apply a transitional measure for tracking and tracing expenditures of IP assets.\n\nThe following deductions may be allowed to ascertain the amount of gains from the sale or disposal of foreign assets chargeable to tax in Singapore: any expenditure incurred by the entity to acquire, create or improve the foreign asset; to protect or preserve the value of the foreign asset; or to sell or dispose of the foreign asset. The expenditure will include expenses incurred to finance the acquisition, creation, and improvement of the foreign asset. The loss mentioned may be deducted subject to certain conditions.\n\nWhere the sale or disposal of a foreign asset by the entity was at a price less than the open-market price for the foreign asset, the Comptroller may treat the following amount as the amount of the gains received in Singapore. The open-market price for a foreign asset is either the price which the foreign asset could have been sold for in the open market on the date of its sale or disposal or, where the Comptroller is satisfied by reason of the special nature of the foreign asset that it is not practicable to determine the price, such other value as appears to the Comptroller to be reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nThe foreign-sourced disposal gains received in Singapore may have been taxed in the foreign jurisdiction before the gains are received in Singapore. A Singapore tax resident entity may claim double taxation relief, unilateral tax credit, or elect for the foreign tax credit pooling system when claiming the foreign tax credit to alleviate the foreign tax suffered on the foreign-sourced disposal gains.\n\nTax exemption under section 13(1)(zu) of the ITA will be given on the capital gains derived from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset where the gains are assessable as the income of an individual. Tax exemption will not be given if the gains are business revenue gains.\n\nTo ensure that entities keep track of the gains/losses from the disposal of foreign assets and accurately report their taxes, they are required to provide specific information with respect to such gains/losses in their tax computations when submitting their annual income tax returns. Entities are required to retain all records reasonably required for the Comptroller to ascertain the amount of net gains from the disposal of foreign assets chargeable to tax.\n\nYou may make an application for advance ruling to seek certainty on the adequacy of economic substance when a proposed sale or disposal of foreign assets is expected to occur. The advance ruling on the adequacy of economic substance, if issued, may be valid for up to five years, including the year relating to the basis period in which the proposed sale or disposal of foreign assets is envisaged to take place.\n\nFor general enquiries or clarifications on this e-Tax guide, please call the provided contact number. \n\nThe document also includes frequently asked questions regarding covered entities, economic substance requirements, covered income, and other related topics. Updates and amendments to the guide are noted, including editorial changes and revisions to specific paragraphs. \n\nAnnexes provide additional information, including a list of assets determined to be situated outside Singapore, guidance on core income generating activities in relation to the economic substance requirement for each sector, examples of transitional measures for tracking and tracing expenditures of IP assets, and illustrations of the computation of foreign-sourced disposal gains and the utilization of losses.",

        "text": "Securities Lending and Repurchase Arrangements\n\nThis e-Tax Guide gives details on the income tax treatments and tax concessions of qualifying securities lending and repurchase (\u201crepo\u201d) arrangements under section 10H of the Income Tax Act 1947 (\u201cITA\u201d). It is relevant to any person who engages in securities lending and repo arrangements.\n\nWhen a person needs certain securities for the purpose of covering a short sale, it can enter into a securities lending arrangement to borrow the securities. It is obliged to provide collateral and return the borrowed securities at a later date. On the other hand, when a person has certain securities but needs cash, it can enter into a securities repo arrangement to sell the securities for cash with the agreement that the securities will be sold back to it at a later date. Both arrangements involve transferring ownership of the securities but only temporarily. If the arrangement is a qualifying arrangement, the person who originally owns the securities will not be treated as having sold the securities.\n\nThis is the tax position for qualifying arrangements: \n\nFor a securities lending arrangement, the lender does not recognize a gain or loss from the transfer of securities, while the borrower does recognize a gain or loss. For a securities repo arrangement, the seller does not recognize a gain or loss from the transfer of securities, while the buyer does recognize a gain or loss.\n\nThis e-Tax Guide replaces the IRAS e-Tax Guide on \u201cIRAS Guide on Securities Lending and Repurchase (\u201cREPO\u201d) Arrangement\u201d published on 23 November 2001.\n\nGlossary\n\nBorrowing fee: This is a fee payable by a borrower to a lender under a securities lending arrangement for the use of the borrowed securities.\n\nCompensatory payments: These refer to payments made by the transferee to the transferor which are of equal value to the distributions made in respect of the transferred securities or collateral that the transferee never receives.\n\nDistribution: This includes the distribution of any income paid under the transferred securities or collateral to the holder of the transferred securities or collateral.\n\nEquivalent securities: Equivalent securities (including securities used as collateral) are securities which are identical in type, nominal value, description, and amount to the transferred securities and collateral.\n\nLoan rebate fee: This is a fee payable by a lender to a borrower when the borrower provides cash collateral to the lender for the transferred securities under a securities lending arrangement.\n\nPrice differential: This is generally the difference between the sale and repurchase price under a securities repo arrangement and is payable by the seller to the buyer.\n\nSecurities lending arrangement: This is an arrangement where a person (\u201clender\u201d) lends its securities to another (\u201cborrower\u201d) in exchange for collateral. The borrower is obliged to return the transferred securities or their equivalent to the lender, either on the lender\u2019s demand or within the period of the arrangement.\n\nSecurities repo arrangement: This is an arrangement where a person (\u201cseller\u201d) sells its securities to another (\u201cbuyer\u201d) for cash and the buyer agrees to sell back the transferred securities or their equivalent at a specified price on an agreed future date or on the seller\u2019s demand.\n\nSingapore-based transferee: A Singapore-based transferee means a transferee who is resident in Singapore or who is not resident in Singapore but enters into the securities lending or repurchase arrangement through a permanent establishment in Singapore.\n\nSingapore-based transferor: A Singapore-based transferor means a transferor who is resident in Singapore or who is not resident in Singapore but enters into the securities lending or repurchase arrangement through a permanent establishment in Singapore.\n\nTransferee: This refers to a person who receives the transferred securities or collateral.\n\nTransferor: This refers to a person who transfers the securities (including securities used as collateral) to another person.\n\nTransferred collateral: These are securities which the borrower passes over to the lender as collateral under a securities lending arrangement.\n\nTransferred securities: These are securities which the lender passes over to the borrower under a securities lending arrangement or the seller passes over to the buyer under a securities repo arrangement.\n\nBackground\n\nA securities lending arrangement involves a lender and a borrower of securities. The lender would transfer the securities to the borrower. In return, the borrower would transfer cash or securities as collateral to the lender. When the borrower subsequently returns the transferred securities or their equivalent to the lender, the lender will return the transferred collateral or its equivalent to the borrower.\n\nIn a securities repo arrangement, the seller sells the securities to a buyer for cash with an agreement that the buyer would sell back the transferred securities or their equivalent to the seller at a later date. Both securities lending and repo arrangements, therefore, require the transfer of securities or collateral and the subsequent return of the transferred securities or collateral or their equivalent. Under the arrangements, legal titles change hands although the transferor continues to retain the economic ownership of the transferred securities or collateral.\n\nBased on ordinary tax rules, the gain or loss arising from the securities lending and repo arrangements is taxable or allowable in the hands of the transferor and transferee at each transfer if it is derived in the normal course of a business or trade.\n\nQualifying securities lending and repo arrangements\n\nIf the securities lending and repo arrangements were qualifying arrangements, instead of applying the general tax position, the tax treatment and concessions explained would apply. These tax treatment and concessions apply to qualifying securities lending and repo arrangements entered into on or after 23 November 2001.\n\nSecurities lending and repo arrangements are treated as qualifying arrangements when the following conditions are satisfied: \n\n1. The transferred securities or collateral do not involve stocks or shares of unlisted Singapore resident companies.\n2. The transferor continues to bear the risks and retains the economic ownership of the transferred securities or collateral during the period of the securities lending or repo arrangement although the legal titles are passed to the transferee.\n\nWith effect from 27 November 2024, the scope of qualifying securities lending and repo arrangements is expanded by removing the condition mentioned. This means that there will no longer be any restriction on the types of securities that can be transferred under a qualifying securities lending and repo arrangement. The tax treatment of all distribution income from transferred securities or collateral will also be aligned with that for dividend and interest income.\n\nEconomic ownership\n\nThe requirements for economic ownership are not limited to the transferor\u2019s entitlement to the distributions on the transferred securities or collateral. The transferor is considered to have retained the economic ownership of the transferred securities or collateral if the following elements are present in a securities lending or repo arrangement:\n\n1. Structure of arrangement: It must be documented in writing.\n2. Risks and rewards of the transferred securities or collateral: The transferor must continue to assume the risks and retain the rewards, including the return of transferred or equivalent securities by the transferee.\n3. Distributions on transferred securities or collateral: The transferee must pass on the distributions on the transferred securities or collateral or make compensatory payments of equal value to the transferor.\n4. Right to receive any part of the total consideration payable under the securities lending or repo arrangement.\n5. Arm\u2019s length consideration: Transferor and transferee must transact on an arm\u2019s length basis and not enter into the arrangement with a view to avoid, reduce or defer Singapore tax.\n6. Transferee\u2019s reasons for acquiring securities: The transferee must acquire the securities for one or more acceptable commercial reasons.\n\nTax treatment of gain/loss from transfer of securities or collateral under qualifying securities lending and repo arrangements\n\nUnder a qualifying securities lending or repo arrangement, the transferor retains economic ownership of the transferred securities or collateral. The transferor only temporarily allows the transferee to use the transferred securities or collateral. Accordingly, for income tax purposes, no gain or loss will be recognized when the transferor transfers the transferred securities or collateral to the transferee. Such transfer is not regarded as a disposal of the securities or collateral by the transferor. Similarly, the transferee subsequently re-transfers the equivalent securities to the transferor, and such re-transfer is not regarded as a re-acquisition of the securities by the transferor.\n\nThere is no specific maximum period imposed on a securities lending or repo arrangement to qualify for this tax treatment. However, when an actual disposal takes place, the transferor has to recognize the gain or loss. Actual disposal can arise under various situations, such as redemption of the transferred securities, directing the transferee to accept a takeover offer, instructing the transferee to sell the transferred securities to the issuer, default by either party, or termination of the arrangement.\n\nThe gain or loss from the actual disposal is taxable or deductible if the transferor carries on the transactions in the normal course of its trade or business. In addition, for any transfer of foreign securities under any securities lending and repo arrangement that occurs on or after 1 January 2024, any gain arising from the arrangement will be treated as income chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(g) of the ITA, if the transfer falls within the scope of section 10L of the ITA.\n\nTax treatment for transferee\n\nA transferee may make a gain or loss from selling the transferred securities or collateral to another person other than the transferor and returning the equivalent securities to the transferor subsequently. The gain or loss is taxable or allowable if the transferee carries on these transactions in the normal course of its trade or business.\n\nThe securities lending and repo arrangement can be terminated under various events. As such, the transferee may not be able to purchase from the market and return the equivalent securities to the transferor. When such an event takes place, the transferee is deemed to have returned the equivalent securities to the transferor and completed the arrangement. Consequently, the transferee is required to recognize the gain or loss.\n\nIn calculating the gain or loss, the transferee must first determine the market value of the transferred securities at the time he borrows them. This market value is then used as the cost of the transferred securities and the sale price of equivalent securities.\n\nTax treatment of actual distribution and compensatory payment arising from qualifying securities lending and repo arrangements\n\nIn order for a transferor to be considered as the economic owner of the transferred securities or collateral under a qualifying securities lending or repo arrangement, when a distribution is made in respect of the transferred securities or collateral, the transferee has to pass on such distribution to the transferor if the transferee receives the distribution or make a payment of equal value to the distribution to the transferor if the transferee does not receive the distribution.\n\nThis requirement is consistent with the terms of standard market agreements. However, in order not to prevent or discourage buy/sell trades in repo markets where compensatory payments are not made, the transferee is not required to make compensatory payment if the repo arrangement relates to Singapore Government Securities or qualifying debt securities.\n\nWhen an actual distribution in respect of the transferred securities or collateral in the hands of a Singapore-based transferee is passed on by the transferee to a transferor, the Singapore-based transferee will not be taxed on the actual distribution received in respect of the transferred securities or collateral. The transferor is regarded as the recipient of the actual distribution made in respect of the transferred securities or collateral. As such, the transferor will be taxed on the distribution passed on by the transferee to it.\n\nA transferor resident in Singapore may submit relevant receipts to claim a tax credit for the actual foreign tax suffered by a Singapore-based transferee on the actual distribution received outside Singapore.\n\nTax treatment of compensatory payment made by transferee\n\nA transferee may not always hold the transferred securities or collateral for the entire period of the securities lending or repo arrangement. The transferee could have delivered them to meet its short selling obligation. As such, the transferee should still make a compensatory payment to the transferor. The transferee will be allowed a deduction for such payment if it is a revenue expense wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of the transferee\u2019s income.\n\nThe transferor, on the other hand, will be taxed on the compensatory payment as follows: All compensatory payments will be taxed at the same tax rate that would have applied to the distribution had it been made directly to the transferor. Where a compensatory payment is in place of any distribution derived from outside Singapore, no tax credit will be allowed to a transferor resident in Singapore as no actual foreign tax had been suffered by the Singapore-based transferee.\n\nTax treatment of other related payments\n\nWhere the borrowing fee, loan rebate fee, price differential, or interest payment derived from collateral is borne directly or indirectly by a resident of or permanent establishment in Singapore or is deductible against any income accruing in or derived from Singapore, they would be deemed to be derived from Singapore and hence, subject to Singapore tax. Singapore withholding tax is applicable if the borrowing fee, loan rebate fee, price differential, or interest payment derived from collateral are payable or paid to non-resident transferor or transferee, unless tax exemption or waiver of obligation to withhold tax is granted.\n\nThe deductibility of the borrowing fee, loan rebate fee, price differential, or interest payment derived from collateral is subject to the existing tax rules.\n\nAdministrative requirements\n\nThe transferor and transferee, or their agent, have to maintain proper records of the securities lending or repo arrangement. Such records include documents showing distributions passed on, compensatory payments made, and economic ownership remains with the transferor. The records are to be retained for a period of 5 years. Upon request, the transferor, transferee, or its agent is to submit full particulars of such records to the Comptroller of Income Tax.\n\nContact information\n\nIf you have any enquiries or need clarification on this e-Tax Guide, please call 1800-356 8622.\n\nUpdates and Amendments\n\nAmendments made on 29 June 2012 included updates to examples and the removal of outdated references. Amendments made on 4 December 2024 included updates to the tax treatment of qualifying securities lending and repo arrangements, the definition of distribution, and other clarifications regarding tax treatments.",

        "text": "GST: Guide for Motor Vehicle Traders\n\nThis guide is for GST registered businesses selling new and/or second-hand motor vehicles. The purposes of this guide are to explain the GST treatment applicable to motor vehicle traders and to illustrate the GST computations for the sale of motor vehicles.\n\nThe business activities of a motor vehicle trader include the importation of motor vehicles, sale of new and used vehicles, and sale of motor vehicle bodies of de-registered vehicles. All motor vehicles in Singapore must be registered with LTA. To curb the growth of vehicle population in Singapore, LTA imposes regulatory charges on the sale of new vehicles. Regulatory charges do not attract GST as they do not relate to the provision of goods or services. All other charges or payments received in relation to a supply of motor vehicles are subject to GST. The GST treatment for the sale of a new motor vehicle differs from that of a second-hand motor vehicle. For the sale of a new vehicle, GST is chargeable on the selling price of the motor vehicle excluding regulatory charges such as COE. For the sale of a second-hand motor vehicle, the computation of the GST chargeable depends on whether the sale is made under the Gross Margin Scheme or the Discounted Sale Price Scheme.\n\nIf you are not a motor vehicle trader, you should use the Discounted Sale Price Scheme when you occasionally sell a second-hand vehicle that has been used in your business.\n\nARF denotes Additional Registration Fee. AFC denotes Additional Flat Component. CIF denotes Cost, Insurance and Freight. COE denotes Certificate of Entitlement. The Discounted Sale Price Scheme is a scheme for the sale of a second-hand motor vehicle whereby GST is charged on 50% of the selling price of the vehicle. The Gross Margin Scheme is a scheme for the sale of a second-hand motor vehicle whereby GST is charged on the difference between the selling price and the purchase price of the vehicle. LTA denotes Land Transport Authority. OPC schemes denote Off-Peak Car schemes. PARF denotes Preferential Additional Registration Fee. RF denotes Registration Fee. A second-hand vehicle is a used motor vehicle which has been registered in Singapore. It excludes any used vehicle which was registered overseas. TCOE denotes Temporary Certificate of Entitlement.\n\nWhen you import motor vehicles from overseas, at the point of importation, GST is payable on the CIF value plus custom duties. You may be granted relief from paying GST on the importation of motor vehicles for certain situations (e.g., re-importing motor vehicles exported temporarily for repair) if you satisfy the import relief conditions. If you wish to obtain relief from paying GST, you must make an application to Singapore Customs before importing the vehicle or sending the vehicle overseas. \n\nFor the sale of motor vehicles to the public, you must display, advertise, publish or quote GST-inclusive prices. For example, you may advertise the GST-inclusive price of a vehicle as $158,533 (inclusive of ARF, COE and GST). This is so that the customer knows upfront the final price payable.\n\nWhen your customer buys a new vehicle, it comes with charges and fees which include ARF, COE, RF and Road Tax. These are charges imposed by LTA on vehicle buyers and do not attract GST as they do not relate to the provision of goods or services. If you include the ARF, COE, RF and Road Tax in your selling price of the new vehicle, GST is to be charged on the Selling Price less ARF, COE, RF and Road Tax paid to LTA.\n\nWhen you sell a car registered under the Revised Off-Peak Car (ROPC) scheme, you should not deduct the full value of ARF and COE from the selling price of the car when computing the value on which GST is to be charged. You should deduct only the net amount of ARF and COE paid to LTA (i.e., ARF and COE less ROPC scheme rebate).\n\nIf you offer discounts on COE to your customers, the COE to be deducted from the selling price of the vehicle for the purpose of computing the GST chargeable is the COE quota premium and not the discounted price of COE. \n\nUpon scrapping a car that is less than 10 years old, your customer may get a PARF/COE rebate. PARF/COE rebates can be used to offset various taxes and fees for a new vehicle. Whether the selling price that you quote to your customer for the new vehicle is before or after deducting the PARF/COE rebate, the amount of GST chargeable is the same.\n\nFor GST purposes, the sale of a motor vehicle under a hire-purchase agreement results in two separate supplies. That is, you are supplying the vehicle to the finance company, which in turn supplies the vehicle to the customer (i.e., hirer) at the same price. Therefore, you must account for GST on the selling price of the vehicle (excluding ARF, COE, RF and Road Tax) as reflected on your tax invoice to the finance company.\n\nFor GST purposes, a second-hand vehicle excludes any used vehicle which was previously registered overseas. This is because when a used vehicle from overseas is imported into Singapore, it is required to be registered and the owner will have to pay COE, ARF and other fees as if it is new. In addition, delivery mileage or the registration for road use does not turn a new vehicle into a second-hand vehicle. A vehicle is \u2018unused\u2019 until either it has been driven on the road following a retail sale or it has been appropriated by the dealer for his business.\n\nYou have the option of two schemes for the calculation of GST on your sale of second-hand vehicles \u2013 the Gross Margin Scheme and the Discounted Sale Price Scheme. If you wish to use the Gross Margin Scheme, please review your eligibility using the form, \u2018Self-Review of Eligibility and Declaration on Use of Gross Margin Scheme Form\u2019, from IRAS\u2019 website and submit the form after completion. You can only begin to apply the Gross Margin Scheme on your sales transactions from the date of submission of the form, based on your declaration that all the conditions of the scheme have been satisfied.\n\nIf you are in the business of selling second-hand vehicles, you can only use the Gross Margin Scheme for the sale of a second-hand vehicle if either one of the following conditions is satisfied: The vehicle was bought from a non-GST registered supplier (e.g., an individual) or the vehicle was bought from a GST-registered supplier who used the Gross Margin Scheme on the sale of the second-hand vehicle to you. You must obtain a sales invoice (not a tax invoice) from the supplier to support your purchase made under the Gross Margin Scheme.\n\nIf you cannot satisfy the conditions, you must charge GST based on the Discounted Sale Price Scheme and issue a tax invoice to your customer. You cannot claim input tax on vehicles purchased under the Gross Margin Scheme. Similarly, when you make a sale under the Gross Margin Scheme, your customer is not allowed to claim input tax on the vehicle. You must not issue a tax invoice to your customer. You can only issue a normal sales invoice containing the details described in the guide. The GST charged is not to be shown on the invoice.\n\nUnder the Gross Margin Scheme, you must account for GST on the difference between the selling price (which is treated as inclusive of GST) and the purchase price of the motor vehicle. If you sell a second-hand vehicle at a loss, no GST is to be accounted for. However, you must report the selling price of the vehicle in Box 1 (Total Value of Standard-rated Supplies) of your GST returns.\n\nUnder the Discounted Sale Price Scheme, GST is charged on 50% of the selling price of the vehicle. This is regardless of whether the vehicle is sold at a profit or loss. If you are a motor trader, you should use the Discounted Sale Price Scheme when you do not satisfy the requirements for the use of the Gross Margin Scheme on the sale of your second-hand vehicle or the customer is registered for GST.\n\nYou can apply the Gross Margin Scheme to the sale of a vehicle body to another motor vehicle trader if you satisfy either one of the following conditions: The vehicle was bought from a non-GST registered supplier (e.g., an individual) or the vehicle was bought from a GST-registered supplier who had used the Gross Margin Scheme on the sale made to you. You must obtain a sales invoice (not a tax invoice) from the supplier to support your purchase made under the Gross Margin Scheme.\n\nWhen you dismantle a vehicle into various parts and sell/scrap the dismantled vehicle parts, you must charge and account for GST on the full selling price of the vehicle parts. The Gross Margin Scheme cannot be applied to the sale of vehicle parts.\n\nIf you sell a TCOE to another motor vehicle trader, you have to account for GST on the profit or value-added element. Generally, when you collect a deposit that forms part payment of the price of a new vehicle, you should account for GST on the full deposit collected unless the deposit is collected for the purpose of bidding for COE.\n\nIn a trade-in situation, there are two separate supplies made: Your sale of the new vehicle to the customer and your customer\u2019s sale of the old vehicle to you. For the sale of the new vehicle, you should account for GST on the actual GST-inclusive selling price of the new vehicle, excluding ARF, COE, RF and Road Tax. \n\nIf you introduce customers who require hire-purchase financing to finance companies and receive a commission from the finance companies, you must account for GST on the commission earned. If you provide hire-purchase financing to your customers, GST is not chargeable on hire-purchase interest and this interest amount should be separately disclosed to the hirer.\n\nWhen you repossess a vehicle that has been sold under a hire-purchase agreement, there is no supply for GST purposes. Therefore, no GST is chargeable. When you subsequently sell the repossessed vehicle, the sale is treated as being made by the hirer. If the hirer is a GST registered person, you must charge and account for GST on the sale on behalf of the hirer. If the hirer is not a GST registered person, you need not charge GST on the sale of the repossessed vehicle.\n\nYou act as an agent for general insurance companies. Upon selling a vehicle, you introduce your customer to the insurance companies for insurance coverage. For the insurance premium paid by your customer, you do not have to charge GST as you are only acting on behalf of the insurance companies. If the insurance companies are registered for GST, they will impose GST on the insurance premiums. You do not need to charge another GST on the premiums collected on behalf of the insurance companies.\n\nWhen a customer buys a new car and requests for accessories, you must charge and account for GST when you recover the cost of the accessories from the customer. If you have incurred GST on the purchase of the accessories, you can claim the GST incurred as input tax.\n\nYou must account for GST on all your supplies of services made in the course of your business. These include handling charges, collection fees, administration fees, agreement fees and commission. Interest collected from late payment is not subject to GST as it is an exempt supply. However, you must report the amount in Box 3 (Total Value of Exempt Supplies) of your GST returns.\n\nAs part of your sales promotion, you offer free accessories to your customers. You need not account for GST on the free gifts as the cost of the \u2018free gifts\u2019 would have already been included in the selling price of the vehicle sold. If you offer free warranties to your customers, you need not account for GST on goods and services provided free of charge during the warranty period.\n\nIf you have paid GST for your business purchases, including imports, you are entitled to claim the input tax incurred if you meet all the conditions for claiming input tax. Pre-registration GST is the GST that businesses incur on supplies of goods or services made to them before they are registered for GST. \n\nOnce you are de-registered from GST registration, a final GST return will be issued to you to file and account for GST up till the last day of the GST registration. In your GST return, you only need to account for output tax based on 50% of the Open Market Value for used vehicles.\n\nIt is the responsibility of business owners and company directors to ensure that proper records are kept. You are expected to put in place a record keeping system to ensure that your GST declarations are duly supported with the required documents. The types of records you need to keep include source documents that substantiate all transactions in your business, records of the steps taken to ascertain whether the supply made to you or by you was a part of a Missing Trader Fraud arrangement, accounting records and schedules, bank statements, and any other records of transactions connected with your business.\n\nFor enquiries on this e-Tax Guide, please contact the Goods and Services Tax Division at the IRAS website.",

For HDB flats, the AV will be reduced by 10% for the 2025 property tax assessment. For private residential properties, the reduction will vary based on the property type and location. This reduction in property tax is expected to provide financial relief to homeowners, especially in light of the rising cost of living. Homeowners are encouraged to check their property tax bills and the AV of their properties on the IRAS website. The Government will provide a one-off Property Tax rebate of 20% for Owner-Occupied HDB flats, and 15%, capped at $1,000, for Owner-Occupied private residential properties in 2025. The rebate will automatically offset any property tax payable. In addition to the rebate, the Government previously announced that all Annual Value bands of the Owner-Occupied residential property tax rates would be raised with effect from 1 January 2025. Homeowners can thus expect to pay the same or lower property taxes at each band, assuming that there is no change in their AVs and before any rebate. As a result of both changes, all Owner-Occupied HDB flats and over 90% of Owner-Occupied private residential properties will see lower property tax in 2025. This will help Singaporeans mitigate cost-of-living concerns. Property owners will receive their 2025 property tax bills from December 2024 onwards. IRAS sends out tax bills in batches, so some property owners may receive them earlier than others. Property owners are reminded to pay their 2025 property tax by the due dates specified in their tax bills. A 5% late payment penalty will be imposed for those who fail to pay or have not set up GIRO instalments by the due date. Property owners are encouraged to apply for GIRO to enjoy up to 12-month interest-free instalments or opt for a one-time deduction. Individual taxpayers may apply for eGIRO via myTax Portal to set up their GIRO arrangement within minutes. In addition, eligible retirees may apply for the Extended GIRO Scheme for Residential Property (Retirees), which provides a longer instalment plan of up to 24 months for property tax payment. Property owners facing financial difficulties may approach IRAS for assistance to discuss a suitable payment plan before the payment due date. More information on 2025 property tax bills can also be found on IRAS\u2019 website.', 'urls': []}",

If you earn an income by buying and selling goods, or from providing professional or personal services, you are a SEP. Examples of SEPs include sole-proprietors, partners of partnership businesses, taxi and private-hire-car drivers, commission agents (e.g. insurance agent, real estate agent), freelancer, and owner of an online business, etc. For more information, you may refer to our website: Am I a self-employed person?\n\nWhat is a qualifying contract between the company and the self-employed person (SEP)?\n\nIt is a contract between the company and the SEP that provides for:\n\nthe rental or loan of an asset by the company to the SEP, for the SEP to carry on his trade, profession, business or vocation; or \nthe provision of services by the SEP to the company, where the SEP and company are in the same trade, profession, business or vocation.\n\nHow much can a company contribute to the SEP\u2019s MediSave Account in any calendar year?\n\nA company can make voluntary contributions to the MediSave account of SEPs.

Please refer to Question 5 on the tax deduction limit.\n\nIs there a limit on the amount of qualifying voluntary MediSave contributions that the company can claim for tax deduction?\n\nFor contributions made in year 2018 and subsequent years, the maximum amount of qualifying voluntary MediSave contributions made by each company in any calendar year that are eligible for tax deduction cannot exceed $2,730 per SEP.\n\nWhat should I do if my company wishes to claim tax deduction for the voluntary MediSave contribution made for the SEPs?\n\nThe company can claim the tax deduction when filing its Income Tax Return. If the company has contributed an amount in excess of $2,730 per SEP per year, the company is required to make the tax adjustments in its income tax computation to disallow the excess contribution when it files its Income Tax Return.\n\nAs a Company, what is the procedure to apply to make voluntary MediSave contributions to Self-Employed Persons (SEPs)?\n\nTo make voluntary MediSave contributions to SEPs, the company needs to submit a request to the CPF Board via \u201cWrite to us\u201d and select the following:\n\n1) \u201cA Business Partner\u201d under I am; \n2) \u201cMy Organisation\u201d under I want to submit a request for; \n3) \u201cMediSave\u201d under Subject; and \n4) Indicate \u201cOther matters\u201d under Category.\n\nWould a SEP be taxed on the qualifying voluntary MediSave contributions by his/her company or companies? How should such receipts be reported by the SEP in his/her income tax return?\n\nWhere the qualifying voluntary MediSave contributions made by a company to its SEP\u2019s MediSave Account are:\n\nco-contributions that are triggered by the SEP\u2019s specific prior contributions to his/her MediSave Account (e.g. under the Drive and Save scheme), such co-contributions are not income in the hands of the SEP and are therefore not taxable; \nnot co-contributions as mentioned in (a), but are related to work done or to be done by the SEP, such contributions are income in the hands of the SEP. Such income is tax exempt up to the limits mentioned in Question 5 above. Any amount of such contributions which is in excess of these limits (\u201cexcess contribution amount\u201d) is taxable.\n\nA SEP need not report the amount of any voluntary MediSave contributions made by a company to his/her MediSave Account, including the excess contribution amount, if any. IRAS will obtain from CPF Board any excess contribution amount for auto-inclusion in the SEP\u2019s tax assessment.\n\nWhat happens if the total voluntary MediSave Contributions received by a SEP exceeds the CPF Annual Limit in a calendar year? How would the excess be refunded?\n\nWhere both the SEP and his/her company have made voluntary MediSave contributions to the SEP\u2019s account in the same calendar year, any excess above the CPF Annual Limit and up to the amount contributed by the SEP will be refunded to the SEP first, without interest. The SEP will not receive tax relief on these refunded contributions. Thereafter, if there are remaining voluntary contributions made by the company still in excess of the CPF Annual Limit, the excess will be refunded to the company.\n\nAs a SEP, does my company\u2019s voluntary contribution to my MediSave account affect how much I can contribute to my own account?\n\nYes. The voluntary contributions made by your company will be considered as part of the total contributions made to your CPF accounts and are subject to the prevailing CPF Annual Limit.\n\nDo contributions made by companies offset the compulsory MediSave contribution that the SEP is required to make?\n\nYes. The contributions made by companies will be used to offset the compulsory MediSave contribution that the SEP is required to make, if any.\n\nHow will I know if my company has contributed to my MediSave Account?\n\nThe contributions made by your company will be reflected in your 15-month CPF Contribution History and Yearly Statement of Account (YSOA). You may check your CPF statements by logging onto my cpf digital services using your Singpass.\n\nCONCURRENT SELF-EMPLOYED AND EMPLOYEE\n\nIf I am concurrently a SEP and an employee, what is the maximum tax-exempt voluntary MediSave contributions I can enjoy?\n\nFor contributions made in 2018 and subsequent years, the maximum amount of tax-exempt voluntary MediSave contributions in a year that you can enjoy is $2,730 per contributor per calendar year. If the same contributor makes contributions to your MediSave Account both as your employer and the company you work with as a SEP, you are regarded as having 1 contributor and not 2 contributors.\n\nSEP CEASES TO BE A SINGAPORE CITIZEN OR SINGAPORE PERMANENT RESIDENT\n\nIf a SEP ceases to be a Singapore citizen or Singapore permanent resident (PR), can a company still make voluntary MediSave contributions to the SEP\u2019s MediSave account if such an amount was already due to be paid when the SEP was still a Singapore citizen or Singapore PR?\n\nOnce a SEP becomes a foreigner (i.e. not a Singapore citizen or Singapore PR), CPF Board would not allow the company to make any voluntary MediSave contribution to the foreigner SEP\u2019s MediSave Account. This is notwithstanding that such an amount was already due to be paid when the SEP was still a Singapore Citizen or Singapore PR. If such an amount is paid in the form of cash directly to the SEP, the tax treatment for the company and SEP is provided in the table below.\n\nTaxpayer Tax treatment \nCompany of SEP\n\namount is an expenditure that is:\n\nThe company may claim the amount as a tax deduction, provided that the \nwholly and exclusively incurred in the production of income; \nnot capital or private-in-nature; and \nnot specifically prohibited from deduction under Section 15 of the Income Tax Act 1947. \nThe tax deduction limit in Question 5 does not apply to the company as the amount is not paid into the foreigner SEP\u2019s MediSave account.\n\nSEP\n\nWhere the amount, had it been allowed to be paid into the SEP\u2019s MediSave account would:\n\nhave been a co-contribution that is triggered by the SEP\u2019s specific prior contributions to his/her MediSave Account (e.g. under the Drive and Save scheme), such amount is not income in the hands of the SEP and is therefore not taxable; \nnot be a co-contribution as mentioned in (a) but is related to work done or to be done by the SEP, such amount is income in the hands of the SEP and is taxable. The SEP will not enjoy the tax exemption mentioned in Question 6 as the amount is not paid into the SEP\u2019s MediSave account.\n\nThe SEP is required to report to IRAS any such amount paid in cash to him/her under the circumstances defined in (b) above since such amount is taxable and is not paid into the SEP\u2019s MediSave Account. The SEP will either:\n\ndeclare such amount as \u201c2. Trade, Business, Profession or Vocation\u201d income when e-Filing his/her Income Tax Return for the year of assessment relating to the basis period in which the amount is due and payable to him/her; or \nemail the information to IRAS, together with the business\u2019 4-line statement, one month before the expected date of cessation/ departure if the SEP is ceasing his/her business or leaving Singapore permanently.",

Compulsory Medisave contributions are made by employers and employees under the Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme. Voluntary Medisave contributions can be made by self-employed individuals or anyone who wishes to top up their Medisave account. Contributions to Medisave can help individuals meet their medical expenses and also qualify for tax relief. Understanding Medisave contributions is essential for effective financial planning and ensuring adequate healthcare coverage. Self-employed persons must make MediSave contributions to the CPF Board upon receipt of the 'Notice of CPF Contributions for Self-employed Persons\u2019. Voluntary MediSave contributions may be claimed as tax relief. You must make compulsory contributions to your MediSave account after you receive the 'Notice of Computation for CPF MediSave Contributions' from IRAS if you are a self-employed person, a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, and your net trade income is more than $6,000. The MediSave amount that you have to contribute yearly depends on your age and net trade income, and the contribution amount is generally a percentage of your total net trade income, subject to a maximum cap. The MediSave contribution rates for self-employed persons vary based on age and net trade income. After filing your Income Tax Return and receiving your income tax bill, you will receive the 'Notice of CPF Contributions for Self-employed Persons' from CPF Board if your net trade income is more than $6,000. The compulsory MediSave contributions must be paid in full to CPF Board within 30 days from the date of issuance of the notice. You may also make voluntary contributions to your MediSave account and claim tax reliefs to lower your taxes.

The Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS) is the estimated savings needed in your MediSave account for basic subsidized healthcare needs in old age.

The Certificate of Residence (COR) is a letter issued by IRAS to certify that the company is a tax resident of Singapore for the purpose of claiming tax benefits under the DTAs or Limited Treaties. Generally, income derived by a Singapore tax resident company from foreign persons or companies may be subject to tax in that foreign jurisdiction. Under the DTAs or Limited Treaties that Singapore has concluded with foreign jurisdictions, Singapore tax residents may enjoy tax benefits on income derived from the foreign jurisdictions. To enjoy such tax benefits, the COR is required by and must be submitted to the tax authority of the DTA partners. For example, if ABC Pte Ltd, a Singapore tax resident company, receives royalty income from Company XYZ, a tax resident of Australia, and is subject to withholding tax at 30% in Australia, it can enjoy a lower withholding tax rate of 10% on the royalty income under the Singapore-Australia DTA by submitting the COR to the Australia tax authority. If a company is not claiming benefits under the DTA but wishes to obtain a letter certifying that it is a tax resident of Singapore, it can complete the Application for Letter of Residence. To obtain a COR, a company must be a tax resident of Singapore. Generally, foreign-owned investment holding companies, nominee companies, and non-Singapore incorporated companies are not eligible for a COR. Foreign-owned investment holding companies with purely passive sources of income and receiving only foreign-sourced income are not eligible for a COR unless they can show that the control and management of the company\u2019s business is exercised in Singapore. Nominee companies are not eligible for a COR as they are not the beneficial owner of the income derived from the DTA partner. Non-Singapore incorporated companies are also not eligible for a COR unless they can show that the control and management of the company\u2019s business is exercised in Singapore. For Variable Capital Companies (VCC), to obtain a COR, a VCC must be a tax resident of Singapore. All COR applications must be filed via mytax.iras.gov.sg, except for specific circumstances. The processing time for applications is within 7 working days. Companies can apply for a COR for the current calendar year and up to 4 back calendar years. If a company\u2019s notice preference is email notifications, it will receive an email notification within 1-3 working days that the digital COR is available. If the preference is paper notices, the paper COR will be sent to the company\u2019s registered address within 4 working days. Companies applying for a tax reclaim form may require IRAS\u2019 certification that certain conditions are met before it can be submitted to the foreign tax authority for claiming DTA benefits. The tax reclaim form must be duly completed and signed, and IRAS will process it within 1 month of receiving the completed form.', 'urls': ['https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/#what-is-a-certificate-of-residence', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/#who-is-eligible-for-a-certificate-of-residence', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/#how-to-apply-for-a-certificate-of-residence', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/#specificCircumstances', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/#faqs', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/#faqs', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/#faqs', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/#faqs', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/#faqs', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/income-deductions-for-companies/companies-receiving-foreign-income/#faqs']}",

Such written permission must also be obtained before any part of this publication is stored in a retrieval system of any nature.\n\nConsultation on the Proposed Multinational Enterprise (Minimum Tax) Regulations \u2013 GloBE Safe Harbours and Transition Rules\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAs announced in the 2024 Budget Statement, Singapore will implement the Multinational Enterprise Top-up Tax (\u201cMTT\u201d) and the Domestic Top-up Tax (\u201cDTT\u201d) under Pillar Two of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) 2.0 initiative, which will impose a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on businesses\u2019 profits from financial years starting on or after 1 January 2025. This will apply to relevant multinational enterprise (\u201cMNE\u201d) groups with annual group revenue of 750 million euros or more in at least two of the four preceding financial years, in line with the Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (\u201cGloBE\u201d) rules.\n\nA public consultation was held from 10 June to 5 July 2024 on the proposed Multinational Enterprise (Minimum Tax) Bill, as well as the subsidiary legislation on the adjustments to the financial accounting net income or loss and the qualifying tax expenses, for the purposes of calculating the effective tax rate and top-up tax based on the GloBE rules.\n\nIRAS is seeking public feedback, from 4 to 18 October 2024, on the proposed subsidiary legislation that will provide further details on the calculation of the top-up tax based on the GloBE rules.\n\n2. Scope of the Consultation\n\nThe proposed subsidiary legislation provides details on the calculation of the top-up tax based on the GloBE rules and specifically, on the following:\n\na. GloBE Safe Harbours to simplify the compliance process; and\n\nb. Adjustments in computing adjusted covered taxes under the transition rules. These rules will apply when an MNE group first comes within the scope of the GloBE rules (including MTT in Singapore) or DTT in Singapore.\n\nThe proposed subsidiary legislation should be read together with the published GloBE Model Rules, Commentary and applicable Administrative Guidance (\u201cAG\u201d) issued by the Inclusive Framework (\u201cIF\u201d) on BEPS for completeness.\n\nGloBE Safe Harbours\n\nWhen a filing entity elects to apply the GloBE Safe Harbours for specified entities of an MNE group in a jurisdiction for a financial year, the top-up amount for those entities for that financial year will be treated as nil, subject to conditions.\n\nThe proposed subsidiary legislation on \u2018GloBE Safe Harbours\u2019 will cover the following safe harbours for the purposes of MTT and DTT (where applicable):\n\na. Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting (\u201cCbCR\u201d) Safe Harbour\n\nThe Transitional CbCR Safe Harbour allows an MNE Group to avoid undertaking detailed GloBE calculations in respect of a jurisdiction through the use of information contained in the MNE Group\u2019s Country-by-Country Report, where conditions are met. As the safe harbour is designed to provide transitional relief for MNE Groups in the initial years during which the GloBE rules come into effect, it is limited to a transitional period for financial years commencing on or before 31 December 2026 and ending on or before 30 June 2028.\n\nb. Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (\u201cQDMTT\u201d) Safe Harbour\n\nThe QDMTT Safe Harbour eliminates the need for an MNE group to perform a MTT calculation in Singapore, in addition to the calculation already required under a QDMTT regime in a foreign jurisdiction. Accordingly, the proposed subsidiary legislation on the QDMTT Safe Harbour is only applicable to MTT.\n\nc. Simplified Calculations Safe Harbour\n\nThe Simplified Calculations Safe Harbour reduces the extent of computation an MNE group has to make under the GloBE rules through the use of alternative calculations. The Simplified Calculations Safe Harbour is available to MNE Groups with non-material constituent entities in a foreign jurisdiction (for MTT) or Singapore (for DTT).\n\nAdjustments in Computing Adjusted Covered Taxes under the Transition Rules\n\nThe proposed subsidiary legislation on \u2018Transition Rules\u2019 will provide for transition rules. These rules allow existing deferred tax accounting attributes at the beginning of the Transition Year of an entity to be used for purpose of computing adjusted covered taxes.\n\nThe proposed subsidiary legislation will also provide for the Transition Year to be refreshed for the purposes of computing DTT. The Transition Year will be refreshed when a foreign jurisdiction introduces the GloBE rules, and such GloBE rules apply to the Singapore entities of an MNE Group, after Singapore implements the DTT. When the Transition Year is refreshed, certain tax attributes under the DTT will be eliminated or re-stated. This is to ensure that the tax attributes under the GloBE rules applied by the foreign jurisdiction and DTT in Singapore are aligned in and after the refreshed Transition Year.\n\n3. Guidelines for Submission\n\nRespondents are requested to observe these guidelines:\n\na. Please use the template provided to provide your feedback and be clear and concise in your comments.\n\nb. Please identify yourself and the organisation you represent (if any) so that we can follow up to clarify any comments if necessary.\n\nc. Please focus your comments on how the drafting of the subsidiary legislation can be better written to make them clearer and to make compliance easier. As the published GloBE Model Rules, Commentary and AG have been agreed by the IF on BEPS, this consultation is not for the purposes of seeking feedback on policy rationale or design of the GloBE rules.\n\nd. Please explain your points with illustrations, examples, data or alternative formulations of the legislation, where possible.\n\nThis proposed subsidiary legislation is released only for the purpose of consultation and should not be used for individual or business decisions as it does not represent the final subsidiary legislation.\n\nAll comments received during the consultation will be reviewed thoroughly and, if accepted, will be incorporated in the subsidiary legislation.\n\nWe reserve the right to publish all or parts of any comments received on an anonymised basis.\n\n4. Feedback Channel\n\nWe request that all interested parties submit your comments using the template, through email to IRAS_Pillar_Two@iras.gov.sg by 18 October 2024.\n\n5.

        "summary": "The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has published a consultation paper on the proposed Multinational Enterprise (Minimum Tax) Regulations, focusing on GloBE Safe Harbours and Transition Rules. This initiative is part of the implementation of the Multinational Enterprise Top-up Tax (MTT) and Domestic Top-up Tax (DTT) under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 2.0 framework, which mandates a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on profits for multinational enterprises (MNEs) starting from financial years on or after January 1, 2025. This applies to MNE groups with annual revenues of \u20ac750 million or more in at least two of the last four financial years.\n\nThe consultation period for public feedback runs from October 4 to October 18, 2024, focusing on proposed subsidiary legislation that details the calculation of top-up taxes based on GloBE rules. Key components include:\n\n1. **GloBE Safe Harbours**: These are designed to simplify compliance for MNEs:\n   - **Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) Safe Harbour**: Allows MNEs to use information from their CbCR to avoid detailed GloBE calculations during a transitional period ending June 30, 2028.\n   - **Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT) Safe Harbour**: Exempts MNEs from performing MTT calculations in Singapore if they are already subject to a QDMTT in another jurisdiction.\n   - **Simplified Calculations Safe Harbour**: Offers alternative calculations to reduce compliance burdens for MNEs with non-material entities in foreign jurisdictions (for MTT) or Singapore (for DTT).\n\n2. **Transition Rules**: These rules allow existing deferred tax attributes to be utilized for computing adjusted covered taxes at the beginning of the Transition Year. The Transition Year may be refreshed when foreign jurisdictions introduce GloBE rules, ensuring alignment of tax attributes under both GloBE and DTT.\n\nThe consultation seeks feedback on the clarity and compliance of the subsidiary legislation, and all comments will be reviewed for potential incorporation into the final legislation. Interested parties are encouraged to submit their feedback via a provided template by October 18, 2024.",

        "text": "{'content': 'The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has taken action against over 4,700 companies for failing to file their corporate income tax returns on time in 2023. These companies were prosecuted for late or non-filing of tax returns, highlighting the importance of compliance with tax obligations. In total, 4,700 companies faced legal action, which included fines and other penalties for their non-compliance. IRAS emphasizes the need for timely filing of tax returns to avoid legal repercussions and ensure smooth business operations. Companies are encouraged to file their tax returns promptly and seek assistance if they face difficulties in meeting their tax obligations. The IRAS reminds companies to file their Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Returns by the statutory due date of 30 Nov 2024. Each year, about 1 in 10 companies fail to comply with their CIT filing obligations despite repeated reminders. In 2023, over 4,700 companies were prosecuted for late or non-filing of tax returns, with total penalties exceeding $4.9 million. Companies that do not file their CIT Returns by the due date can be fined up to $5,000. Depending on the company\u2019s past compliance records, IRAS may compound the offence instead of taking prosecution actions. A company that receives a letter of composition must pay the composition amount and file the overdue tax return, failing which it will be issued a Notice to Attend Court. Errant companies that fail to file their returns for 2 years or more may be ordered by the courts to pay a penalty twice the amount of tax assessed, in addition to the fine. For companies that do not file their returns, IRAS may issue notices to the company directors to request the company\u2019s financial information. Directors who fail to furnish the information by the stipulated date will be subject to heavier penalties of up to $10,000 or court attendance. Failure to attend court may result in a warrant of arrest issued against the company director. In 2023, 1,690 court summons were issued to directors who did not comply with these notices. About 262,000 companies are expected to file CIT Returns this year. To avoid any last-minute rush, companies are encouraged to prepare their financial statements, tax computations, and supporting documents well in advance. Preparing and filing tax returns ahead of the deadline helps companies avoid unnecessary fines and provides ample time to review the documents, reducing the likelihood of mistakes. IRAS supports companies by making the annual tax filing process easier and faster. The Basic Corporate Income Tax Calculator has explanatory notes to guide companies in working through their tax computations and validation checks against common errors. Companies that adopt software with seamless filing capabilities can enjoy up to 95% time-savings and improved compliance as their tax computations and returns are automatically generated and filed from their software. They can also enjoy automatic extension of the CIT filing due date by 15 days to 15 Dec 2024. Qualifying companies with annual revenue of $200,000 or less can file Form C-S (Lite), which only requires them to fill in six essential fields \u2013 two-thirds less compared to the Form C-S. Companies which require assistance on the YA 2024 tax filing can visit the IRAS website or check out the comprehensive list of e-learning videos. They can also chat with IRAS officers over live chat, call the helpline at 1800 356 8622, or contact IRAS via myTax Mail if they need further support. If there are errors discovered in past years\u2019 CIT Returns, companies should initiate a voluntary disclosure to IRAS to avoid hefty penalties.', 'urls': ['https://www.iras.gov.sg/news-events/newsroom/taxes/corporate-income-tax/form-c-s-form-c-s-(lite)-form-c-filing/preparing-a-tax-computation#basic-corporate-income-tax-calculator', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/news-events/newsroom/taxes/corporate-income-tax/form-c-s-form-c-s-(lite)-form-c-filing/using-accounting-software-to-prepare-file-form-c-s-seamlessly', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/news-events/newsroom/go.gov.sg/cslite', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/news-events/newsroom/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/corporate-income-tax-filing-season-2024', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/news-events/newsroom/go.gov.sg/citelearning']}",

        "text": "Filing of Income Tax Computations in Functional Currencies other than Singapore Dollars (Second Edition)\n\nThis e-Tax Guide explains the rules for filing income tax computations in non-S$ currencies. It applies to businesses that prepare their financial statements in non-S$ functional currencies.\n\nFor accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2003, companies are required to prepare their financial statements in their functional currencies, which may be non-S$. Sole proprietorships and partnerships may also choose to prepare their financial statements in non-S$ functional currencies.\n\nWhere a company, sole proprietorship, or a partnership prepares its financial statements in a non-S$ functional currency, its tax computation should also be prepared in the same functional currency. This applies to all items within the tax computation up to the chargeable income for a company, distributable profit/loss/other income as well as the capital allowances claimed for a partnership, and adjusted profit/loss (but before any loss brought forward) and the capital allowances claimed for a sole proprietorship. These three items will then be converted into S$ at the average rate for the relevant Year of Assessment.\n\nIf a business shifts from S$ to a non-S$ currency as its functional currency, it would have to translate its existing S$ balances into the non-S$ functional currencies. Such businesses can opt to use either the changeover rate or average rate method for the purpose of translating the existing S$ balances. The business has to elect its choice of method when the tax computation is first submitted in non-S$ functional currencies, and such election is irrevocable.\n\nIn addition to the existing S$ balances, there may be other items for which translation is necessary. A summary of the respective translation methods for these items can be found in the guide.\n\nBusinesses include companies, sole proprietorships, and partnerships. Capital allowances are claimed by a business under specific sections of the Income Tax Act for a Year of Assessment. Current year loss items refer to unabsorbed capital allowances, trade losses, and donations for the current year. Existing companies are those that have submitted income tax computations in S$ prior to the relevant first Year of Assessment. Existing S$ balances refer to unabsorbed tax items, tax written down value of existing assets, cost of the assets granted capital allowances that have yet to be disposed of, and prior year income/expense items.\n\nThe functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which a business operates. Newly incorporated companies refer to those that prepare their financial statements in non-S$ functional currency since incorporation. Prior year income/expense items are S$ items derived/incurred and included in prior year tax computations but were taxable/allowable only in a subsequent Year of Assessment when the financial statements are prepared in non-S$ functional currency. Tax written down value refers to the cost of an asset that has not yet been given tax relief by way of capital allowances.\n\nFor accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2003, the Company Act requires companies to comply with the Financial Reporting Standards of Singapore and the Interpretations of FRS. The FRS requires a company to determine its functional currency and measure its results and financial position in that currency.\n\nConsequently, the Income Tax Act was amended to provide for the filing of income tax computations in the same non-S$ functional currency as that used for the financial statements. The earliest Year of Assessment for this change is YA 2004 for a business with an accounting period beginning on 1 January 2003, and YA 2005 for a business with an accounting period beginning after 1 January 2003.\n\nFor sole proprietorships and partnerships that have chosen to prepare their financial statements in non-S$ functional currencies, they should file their tax computations in the same non-S$ functional currencies. Such financial statements should continue to be certified true and correct by the sole proprietors or precedent partners.\n\nThe general rules for filing income tax computations in non-S$ functional currencies are as follows: For companies, all items in their tax computations up to the chargeable income should be in their non-S$ functional currencies; for partnerships, all items in their computations up to the distributable profit/loss/other income as well as the capital allowances claimed should be in their non-S$ functional currencies; and for sole proprietors, all items in their tax computations up to the adjusted profit/loss (but before any loss brought forward) should be in their non-S$ functional currencies.\n\nBusinesses have an irrevocable option of translating all the existing S$ balances into the non-S$ functional currency using either the changeover rate or the average rate. The changeover rate is the average of the exchange rates of the 12 months before the end of the last accounting period in which the financial statements are submitted in S$. The average rate is the accounting period that constitutes the basis period for that Year of Assessment.\n\nFor example, if the company\u2019s basis period for YA 2021 is from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020, the relevant exchange rates to be used for the two options would be the average of the exchange rates from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 for the changeover rate, or the average of the exchange rates from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 for the average rate.\n\nThe rules below apply to existing companies and newly incorporated companies. Illustrations of income tax computations of existing companies using the changeover rate method and average rate method can be found in the annexes. The existing S$ balances for existing companies should be translated into the non-S$ functional currencies using either the changeover rate method or the average rate method. Companies must make an irrevocable election to apply one method in the first Year of Assessment when they submit their tax return in their non-S$ functional currency.\n\nThe existing S$ balances of tax written down value of existing assets and prior year income/expenses translated into the non-S$ functional currency amounts should be used to compute the current year capital allowances and deductions in that non-S$ functional currency. Any unabsorbed non-S$ balances will be carried forward to subsequent Years of Assessment in specific ways depending on the method used.\n\nAll other current year items of companies will be reflected in the companies\u2019 tax computations in the non-S$ functional currencies as shown in the companies\u2019 financial statements. Further tax deductions and investment allowances given based on current year expenditure will be shown in the companies\u2019 tax computations in the non-S$ functional currencies without the need for translation.\n\nA sale of property between related parties may be eligible for an election under section 24 of the Income Tax Act. If the buyer and the seller have different functional currencies, the tax written down value of the property in the seller\u2019s functional currency must be translated to the buyer\u2019s functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the sale.\n\nA transfer of property without consideration as a result of business conversion may be eligible for an election under section 25 of the Income Tax Act. If the transferor and transferee have different functional currencies, the tax written down value of the property in the transferor\u2019s functional currency must be translated to the transferee\u2019s functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transfer.\n\nCurrent year loss items that qualify for transfer under the group relief system will be transferred out based on the non-S$ functional currency of the transferor. Where the functional currency of the transferor is different from the claimant, the current year loss items will be translated into the claimant\u2019s functional currency at the average rate.\n\nExchange gains/losses of a revenue nature might have been recognized in the companies\u2019 accounts but were regarded as \u201cunrealised\u201d for tax purposes. These exchange gains/losses would have been excluded from the tax computation of the relevant Year of Assessment and would be treated as taxable/deductible only in a subsequent Year of Assessment when the gains/losses are realized or deemed realized for tax purposes.\n\nWith effect from YA 2004, businesses have to align the tax treatment of foreign exchange gains/losses of a revenue nature with the accounting treatment unless an election was made to opt out of the tax treatment in YA 2004. Any unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses of these businesses which have not been taxed or deducted before YA 2004 would be deemed realized in YA 2004.\n\nThese unrealized exchange gains/losses in S$ may be realized or deemed realized in a Year of Assessment where the reporting was in non-S$ functional currency. In this case, the gains/losses shall be translated to the non-S$ functional currency using the same exchange rate used for the purpose of translating the existing S$ balances.\n\nForeign exchange gains/losses arising from a change in functional currency are not taxable or deductible for income tax purposes.\n\nCompanies granted tax incentives under the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act may be subjected to a preferential tax rate on their income exceeding a specified amount. This amount in S$ should be translated into the non-S$ functional currency using the average rate for the relevant Year of Assessment.\n\nAny tax exemption granted under specific sections of the Income Tax Act should be translated into the companies\u2019 non-S$ functional currency using the average rate for the relevant Year of Assessment.\n\nTax payable by companies shall be in S$. This is computed by multiplying the companies\u2019 chargeable income in their non-S$ functional currencies (after applying the partial or full tax exemption) with the corporate tax rate and translating the tax payable into S$ using the average rate.\n\nDouble taxation relief or unilateral tax credit is to be allowed at the lower of Singapore tax payable on the foreign sourced income or the foreign tax paid. The Singapore tax payable on the relevant foreign sourced income should be translated into S$ using the average rate of the same Year of Assessment.\n\nThe foreign tax paid in non-S$ functional currency should be translated into S$ using the average rate of the same Year of Assessment.\n\nTax deducted at source in respect of Singapore interest from loan stocks or distributions from REIT will be allowed based on the actual S$ amount withheld by the payer company. The amount withheld should be shown on the Singapore dividend statements.\n\nResident companies that pay dividends in their non-S$ functional currencies must provide the S$ equivalent of the dividend paid in the dividend voucher/notification, where applicable. The non-S$ functional currencies should be translated into S$ equivalent amount using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment of each dividend.\n\nAny S$ interest received from loan stock where Singapore tax has been deducted at source should be translated into the company\u2019s functional currency for the purposes of income tax filing. This translation is to be done using the average rate for the Year of Assessment concerned.\n\nWhere the dividend/interest is received in non-S$, the recipient has to translate the S$ equivalent of the dividend/interest into its own non-S$ functional currency using the average rate. The translation has to be done even if the recipient and payer companies of the dividend/interest used the same non-S$ functional currency.\n\nA summary of the translation method for the respective tax items is provided in the guide.\n\nFor partnerships whose financial statements are prepared in non-S$ functional currencies, all items up to the distributable profit/loss/other income as well as the capital allowances claimed should be in their non-S$ functional currencies. The rules applicable to companies will similarly apply to partnerships, except for those in relation to the transfer of loss items under the group relief system, income under tax incentives, partial or full tax exemption, and tax payable.\n\nThe precedent partner of the partnership must make an irrevocable election in writing, in the first tax return submitted in non-S$ functional currency. The election shall specify the method of translating the existing S$ balances. The amount of profit/loss/other income and capital allowances allocated to each partner will then be translated into S$ at the average rate for inclusion in the tax computation of each partner.\n\nAny loss and capital allowance that cannot be absorbed or fully absorbed by a partner will be carried forward to the next Year of Assessment or carried back to the preceding Year of Assessment in S$ in that individual partner\u2019s tax computation.\n\nFor sole proprietors, all items in their tax computations up to the adjusted profit/loss (but before any loss brought forward) should be in their non-S$ functional currencies. Capital allowances for the trade or business should also be reflected in the non-S$ functional currencies.\n\nA sole proprietor should make an irrevocable election in writing on the method of translating any existing S$ balances. Such an election must be made in the first year when the sole proprietor submits the tax return and financial statements of the sole proprietorship in non-S$ functional currency.\n\nThe adjusted profit/loss, and capital allowances for the current year, as reflected in the non-S$ functional currency should be translated into S$ at the average rate. Unabsorbed losses brought forward in S$ from the previous Year of Assessment can then be set off against the current year adjusted profit that is translated into S$.\n\nIf the sole proprietorship incurs an adjusted loss for the current year, such loss (and the capital allowance) for the Year of Assessment, as translated into S$, can be set off against other sources of income of the sole proprietor. Any loss and capital allowance that remain unabsorbed can be carried forward to the following Year of Assessment or carried back to the preceding Year of Assessment in S$.\n\nAny foreign sourced income received by the sole proprietorship should be translated into S$ using the average rate. All reliefs including double taxation relief, unilateral tax credit, or personal relief will be computed and allowed in S$. Tax deducted at source in respect of interest from loan stocks will be allowed based on the actual S$ amount withheld by the payer company.\n\nAn example of the tax computation of an individual taxpayer whose sole proprietorship business is carried on in non-S$ functional currency is provided in the annexes.\n\nBusinesses are required to complete their income tax return and the appendices in S$. This is so even if they conduct their operations and submit their tax computations in non-S$ functional currencies.\n\nTo comply with this requirement, businesses need to translate the relevant non-S$ items into S$ equivalent amounts for the purpose of completing the tax return and its appendices. This can be done using the average rate or changeover rate, whichever is applicable.\n\nIf you have any enquiries or need clarification on this Guide, please call the relevant contact numbers provided.\n\nUpdates and amendments to the guide have been made, including the removal of outdated references, updates to specific paragraphs, and the addition of new information regarding tax treatment and examples.\n\nAnnex A provides a sample tax computation for an existing company that opts for the changeover rate method. Annex B provides a sample tax computation for an existing company that opts for the average rate method. Annex C provides a sample tax computation for a newly incorporated company. Annex D provides a sample tax computation for an existing sole proprietor who opts for the changeover rate method.",

        "text": "Tax Deduction for Expenses Incurred on Renovation or Refurbishment Works Done to Business Premises\n\nThis e-Tax Guide explains the tax deduction granted under section 14N of the Income Tax Act 1947 for capital expenses incurred by taxpayers for the renovation or refurbishment works done to their business premises. This guide is relevant to a taxpayer carrying on a trade, business, or profession and has incurred expenditure on any renovation or refurbishment works for that trade, business, or profession.\n\nCertain qualifying capital expenses, up to an expenditure cap, incurred on or after 16 Feb 2008 for the renovation or refurbishment works done to the business premises can be claimed as tax deductions against the income derived from that business. The deduction is given over a period of three consecutive years on a straight-line basis, starting from the year of assessment for which those expenses were incurred. For qualifying R&R expenditure incurred in the basis period for YAs 2021, 2022, 2024, and from 2025 onwards, a taxpayer has the option to claim the deduction in one year instead of over three years, as announced in Budget 2020, 2021, 2023, and 2024. S14N deductions can be claimed on qualifying R&R expenditure up to an expenditure cap of $300,000 for every three-year period, starting from the YA in which the business first incurred R&R expenditure and made a claim. As announced in Budget 2024, the relevant three-year period will be fixed for all taxpayers from YA 2025 onwards, with the first fixed three-year period being from YA 2025 to YA 2027.\n\nThe table below summarizes the tax treatment under section 14N of the ITA set out above:\n\nRelevant three-year period for the R&R expenditure cap: On or after 16 Feb 2008, up to YA 2024. Claims are subject to an expenditure cap of $300,000 for every relevant three-year period, starting from the YA in which the business first incurred R&R expenditure and made a claim under S14N. The three-year period for computing the R&R expenditure cap may differ for each individual business. For YA 2025 onwards, claims are subject to an expenditure cap of $300,000 for every fixed three-year period, with the first fixed three-year period being from YA 2025 to YA 2027. The three-year period for computing the R&R expenditure cap will be the same for all businesses.\n\nQualifying R&R expenditure are to be written off over a period of three consecutive years, on a straight-line basis. For YA 2021, YA 2022, YA 2024, and from YA 2025 onwards, businesses are given the option to claim the qualifying R&R expenditure incurred in one year instead of over three years.\n\nBusinesses often need to renovate or refurbish their business premises to remain competitive and to attract customers. Such R&R expenditure are generally capital expenses unless they relate to repairs or replacement works on the premises with no improvement element. Such capital expenses are not permissible deductions under the ITA unless specific provisions are made to allow them. To help businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, reduce business costs, section 14N was introduced into the ITA to allow a tax deduction for qualifying R&R expenditure incurred by businesses. The deduction, henceforth referred to in this e-Tax Guide as \u201cS14N deduction,\u201d is applicable to the R&R expenditure incurred on or after 16 Feb 2008.\n\nS14N deduction is given over a period of three consecutive years, on a straight-line basis, starting from the YA for which the qualifying R&R expenditure were incurred. The claim for S14N deduction cannot be deferred. As announced in Budget 2020, 2021, and 2023, a taxpayer will be given the option to claim qualifying R&R expenditure incurred in the basis period for YA 2021, YA 2022, and YA 2024 in one year instead of over three years. From YA 2025 onwards, the option to claim qualifying R&R expenditure in one year instead of over three years will be permanently available to businesses, as announced in Budget 2024. The option, once elected in the YA, is irrevocable. S14N deduction is given as long as the trade, business, or profession for which the R&R expenditure is incurred is carried on during the basis period. If no income is derived from the trade, business, or profession in any YA and that trade, business, or profession ceases permanently during the basis period for that YA, no S14N deduction is to be given in that YA.\n\nS14N deduction can be claimed on qualifying R&R expenditure up to an expenditure cap of $300,000 for every three-year period, starting from the YA in which the business first incurred R&R expenditure and claimed deductions under S14N. In the case of partnerships, the expenditure cap of $300,000 is applied at the partnership level. For a sole proprietor, the same expenditure cap is applicable regardless of the number of trades being carried on. As announced in Budget 2024, to ease businesses\u2019 compliance burden, the relevant three-year period for claiming R&R expenditure will be fixed for all businesses, with the first fixed three-year period being from YA 2025 to YA 2027. This will replace the regime where the relevant three-year period depends on when the business first incurred R&R expenditure and made a claim under Section 14N.\n\nIf the renovation or refurbishment works qualify as repairs or replacements with no improvement element, tax deduction can be claimed under section 14(1)(c) of the ITA. Similarly, if the R&R expenditure qualifies as expenses incurred on the purchase of plant or machinery under section 19 or section 19A of the ITA, capital allowances can be claimed under those sections. In these scenarios, S14N deduction cannot be claimed on the same R&R expenditure incurred.\n\nS14N deduction is allowed against the income from the trade, business, or profession for which the R&R expenditure is incurred, after all other deductions under Part 5 of the ITA have been allowed. Any unabsorbed S14N deduction due to insufficient trade income forms part of the trade losses for which the normal tax treatment for trade losses applies. This means that such unabsorbed S14N deduction can be carried forward for offset against income in subsequent YAs, subject to the provisions of section 37 of the ITA. It can also qualify for group relief under section 37B of the ITA and loss carry-back relief under section 37D of the ITA, subject to the provisions of those sections.\n\nAll R&R expenditure, other than those relating to structural changes made to business premises and the costs described, will qualify for S14N deduction, up to the expenditure cap. Under the Building Control Act, if structural changes are made to a building, an approval from the Commissioner of Building Control is required. As long as prior approval from the Commissioner of Building Control is not required for the renovation or refurbishment works carried out in the business premises, the R&R expenditure will be considered as qualifying R&R expenditure for S14N deduction.\n\nClaim for S14N deduction on the following expenditure is not allowable: any designer services or professional services, except designer services or professional services which do not affect the structure of the business premises from YA 2025; any antique; any type of fine art including painting, drawing, print, calligraphy, mosaic, sculpture, pottery, or art installation; or any works carried out to a place of residence provided to or to be provided to employees. R&R expenditure incurred on items which do not affect the structure of the business premises and not excluded will generally qualify for S14N deduction. Some examples are general electrical installation and wiring to supply electricity; general lighting; hot/cold water system (pipes, water tanks, etc.); gas system; kitchen fittings (sinks, pipes, etc.); sanitary fittings (toilet bowls, urinals, plumbing, toilet cubicles, vanity tops, wash basins, etc.); doors, gates, and roller shutters (manual or automated); fixed partitions (glass or otherwise); wall coverings (such as paint, wallpaper, etc.); floorings (marble, tiles, laminated wood, parquet, etc.); false ceilings and cornices; ornamental features or decorations that are not fine art (mirrors, drawings, pictures, decorative columns, etc.); canopies or awnings (retractable or non-retractable); fitting rooms in retail outlets; hacking work on premises; windows (including glass frosting, the grilles, etc.); water meter installed to enable renovation works; hoarding works; and insurance for renovation works qualifying for S14N deduction.\n\nTaxpayers who wish to opt for the one-year write-off for S14N deduction in respect of R&R expenditure incurred should indicate the election in the tax computation submitted for the relevant YA. For taxpayers who are not required to submit the tax computation, the amount of allowable expenses claimed, as declared in the tax return, would be the amount after taking into account the one-year write-off for S14N deduction. Taxpayers should maintain sufficient documents to substantiate their claims. However, they do not need to submit these documents together with their tax returns. They are only required to submit the supporting documents when requested to do so as part of IRAS\u2019 audit or verification process. Some examples of supporting documents that should be retained are an itemised list (including the related costs incurred) of the renovation or refurbishment works done to the business premises with addresses of the premises; confirmation that the renovation or refurbishment works in the itemised list do not require the approval of the Commissioner of Building Control; and invoices and payment details of the relevant expenditure.\n\nIf you have any inquiries or need clarification on this Guide, please call IRAS at 1800-3568622 (for companies) or 1800-3568300 (for individuals).\n\nThe previous e-tax guide first published on 18 June 2008 was updated for the following tax changes announced in Budget 2012: removal of the end-date of 15 Feb 2013; increase in the expenditure cap from $150,000 to $300,000 from YA 2013; allowing unabsorbed S14Q deduction to qualify for group relief from YA 2013. The previous e-tax guide published on 6 June 2012 is updated with the following changes: revised paragraph to remove the requirement to submit the itemised list and confirmation in the tax return that the renovation or refurbishment works do not require the approval of the Commissioner of Building Control. The previous e-tax guide published on 6 June 2013 is updated with the following changes: included sub-paragraph to state that S14N deduction is not allowable on R&R costs incurred to a place of residence for staff; included additional qualifying items; paragraph has been moved to a footnote; examples in the Annex have been updated to more recent YA. The previous e-tax guide published on 1 April 2020 is updated with the following changes: incorporated the tax change announced in Budget 2020; inserting paragraphs; updating example in Frequently Asked Questions of the Annex; removed references relating to time-barred YAs. The previous e-tax guide published on 25 Jan 2018 is updated with the following changes: updated the tax change announced in Budget 2021; updating paragraphs; updating example in Question 3 in Frequently Asked Questions of the Annex to provide clarity on how the examples are arrived at. The previous e-tax guide published on 23 March 2022 is updated with the following changes: updated the tax change announced in Budget 2023; incorporated the tax changes announced in Budget 2024; inserting a table in paragraph to show the change in tax treatment for qualifying R&R expenditure incurred from YA 2025 onwards; inserting paragraphs; updating paragraphs; updated examples in the Annex to more recent YAs; inserted examples in the Annex to show how the relevant three-year period is identified from YA 2025; made editorial changes to various paragraphs.\n\nWhen can I claim S14N deduction? You should claim S14N deduction on the qualifying R&R expenditure at the time of lodgement of your tax return for the YA for which the R&R expenditure is first incurred. Any qualifying R&R expenditure, which is not claimed in the YA for which it is first incurred, do not qualify for deduction in subsequent YAs. Any R&R expenditure which is incurred before you commence your business is deemed to be incurred on the first day of the commencement of your business. In such a case, you should claim the S14N deduction in the YA which relates to the basis period in which you commence your business.\n\nHow is the relevant three-year period for the purpose of applying the expenditure cap of $300,000 identified prior to YA 2025? Assume that a taxpayer (newly incorporated on 1 Mar 2018 and with accounting period ending 31 Dec) has incurred qualifying R&R expenditure on its business premises during the period from 1 Mar 2018 to 31 Dec 2023. The first relevant three-year period is YA 2019 to YA 2021 (for costs incurred between 1 Mar 2018 to 31 Dec 2020) and the second relevant three-year period is from YA 2022 to YA 2024 even though no R&R expenditure were incurred in the basis period for YA 2022, as shown in the table above.\n\nHow is the relevant three-year period for the purpose of applying the expenditure cap of $300,000 identified from YA 2025? The relevant three-year period will be replaced with a fixed three-year period starting from YA 2025. Assume that the taxpayer\u2019s financial year is from 1 Jan to 31 Dec, and its last relevant three-year period was from YA 2022 to YA 2024. The taxpayer will transit to the fixed three-year period from YA 2025 and will be allowed a $300,000 expenditure cap from YA 2025 to YA 2027. However, the taxpayer would not be able to claim any further S14N deduction for YA 2026 and YA 2027, as the taxpayer has already incurred qualifying R&R expenditure up to the $300,000 expenditure cap for the fixed three-year period in YA 2025.\n\nHow is S14N deduction computed? The following examples illustrate how S14N deduction is computed. Taxpayer A incurs qualifying R&R expenditure of $240,000 on 31 Jan 2018. Taxpayer A can claim S14N deduction of $80,000 against its income for YAs 2019, 2020, and 2021. If Taxpayer A ceases its business permanently on 31 Dec 2019, Taxpayer A will be granted S14N deduction of $80,000 against its business income for YAs 2019 and 2020. As there is no income derived from the business from 1 Jan 2020, the balance of $80,000 will not be allowed for YA 2021. Taxpayer B incurs qualifying R&R expenditure on the following dates: $240,000 on 31 Jan 2018; $210,000 on 1 May 2020; $30,000 on 15 Apr 2021; $90,000 on 4 Sep 2022. The taxpayer wishes to claim the R&R expenditure of $210,000 and $30,000 in one year as it has sufficient trade income for YAs 2021 and 2022 to fully absorb the deduction. The total amount of expenditure incurred during the third relevant three-year period exceeds the cap of $300,000. Taxpayer B is granted S14N deduction of $290,000 against its income for YA 2021, $30,000 against its income for YA 2022, and $20,000 against its income for YA 2023. \n\nCan I claim a deduction under section 14(1)(c) on the costs I incur on replacing a renovation item that was previously granted S14N deduction? Yes, provided the conditions under section 14(1)(c) are satisfied and the deduction is not denied under section 15. Consequently, if you claim a deduction under section 14(1)(c), you are not allowed S14N deduction on the same replacement costs incurred by you. \n\nCan the R&R expenditure incurred on premises that I use for both business and other personal purposes qualify for S14N deduction? For premises that are used for both business and other personal purposes, only R&R expenditure which are specifically identifiable to the area that is used for business purposes can qualify for S14N deduction. If you cannot specifically identify the R&R expenditure to the area used for business purposes, you are not allowed to claim S14N deduction, as no apportionment of the R&R expenditure is allowable for tax purposes. \n\nWhat are the tax consequences if I was required to seek the approval of the Commissioner of Building Control for my renovation or refurbishment works but failed to do so, and I had claimed a S14N deduction on my R&R expenditure? You should ensure that your R&R expenditure is qualifying expenditure before making any S14N deduction claim. If S14N deduction was erroneously allowed to you under such circumstance, an amount equal to the total deductions that were erroneously allowed previously is deemed as your taxable income for the YA in which the Comptroller discovers the incorrect claim. Where there is any form of fraud or wilful default committed by a taxpayer in connection with its claim for R&R expenditure under section S14N, the Comptroller can raise additional assessments on the taxpayer at any time as provided under section 74(2) of the ITA. Additional penalties are applicable under the ITA. \n\nIs S14N deduction applicable to a business of making investments which is subject to the provisions of section 10D of the ITA? Yes. The business may claim S14N deduction on qualifying R&R expenditure incurred on renovation or refurbishment works done to the properties which are rented out by the business as part of its business of making investments.",

        "text": "GST: Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP)\n\nThe 'Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme' (ACAP) is a compliance initiative introduced for businesses to voluntarily undertake a holistic risk-based review on the robustness and effectiveness of their internal controls to manage their GST risk and enhance their GST compliance capability. This e-Tax Guide explains this initiative in greater detail.\n\nYou should read this e-Tax guide if you are:\n\n(a) A GST-registered business which intends to undergo an ACAP Review and wants to build or enhance your GST controls and improve your GST compliance capability to file correct GST returns on a continual basis; or\n\n(b) An ACAP Reviewer appointed by a GST-registered business to conduct an ACAP Review.\n\nThe ACAP process comprises 3 key segments:\n\n1. Self-Review of GST Controls\n- Complete the \u201cSelf-Review of GST Controls checklists\u201d (SRC) to assess if your GST controls are established at three levels (Entity, Transaction and GST Reporting) to ensure continual GST compliance.\n- Examine if the design and application of your GST controls are adequate to address GST risks of filing incorrect GST returns though your GST control framework may have met IRAS' minimum acceptable standard of an established GST control framework for ACAP.\n\n2. Commence ACAP Review and Implement Additional Controls\n- Following your self-assessment of the effectiveness of your GST controls, you may participate in the ACAP Review by engaging an independent ACAP Reviewer screened by IRAS to conduct a holistic review of your GST controls using the ACAP Review methodology set out in the \u201cGST ACAP Review Guidance\u201d.\n- The ACAP Reviewer will conduct an independent review of the effectiveness of your GST controls using its professional auditing methodology and in accordance with the ACAP Review methodology.\n- Based on the ACAP Reviewer\u2019s findings, you will evaluate the impact of any GST gaps identified and errors made in your past and current GST returns and take active steps to improve your existing controls.\n\n3. Proactive Review of GST Risks and Monitoring\n- IRAS will accord you an ACAP status if you demonstrate that the GST controls established at all three levels (Entity, Transaction and GST Reporting) are working effectively, based on the findings of the ACAP Reviewer.\n- During the validity period of your ACAP status, you will continue to review and monitor the effectiveness of your GST risk management process from internal and external changes. You will also be required to provide assurance of your oversight on GST matters to ensure continuous GST compliance by performing the Post ACAP Review (PAR).\n- You are encouraged to renew your ACAP status prior to the expiry date of your ACAP status in lieu of the second PAR. Renewing your ACAP status assures your stakeholders of the sustainability and robustness of your GST risk management process in the filing of correct GST returns on an ongoing basis.\n\nGlossary\n\nACAP: Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme\n\nACAP Applicant: A GST-registered business which is approved by IRAS to participate in ACAP.\n\nACAP Period: A 12-month period of either the latest 12-month period of GST returns filed or the 12-month period of GST returns filed for the past financial year.\n\nACAP Review: An independent review performed by an ACAP Reviewer covering a 12-month ACAP Period.\n\nACAP Reviewer: Public Accounting Entity (PAE) and/or its tax affiliate with a track record in conducting audit and/or GST return reviews of large businesses.\n\nACAP Status: A status awarded to an ACAP Applicant which completed the ACAP Review and meets the IRAS\u2019 ACAP standard.\n\nApproved ACAP Business: An ACAP Applicant awarded with either an \u2018ACAP Premium\u2019 or \u2018ACAP Merit\u2019 status.\n\nPost ACAP Review (PAR): A review performed by an Approved ACAP Business following accord of the ACAP status.\n\nTest Period: A 6-month period from the ACAP Period selected by the ACAP Reviewer to perform review testing for ACAP Review.\n\nOverview of ACAP Process\n\nThe ACAP is most suitable for GST-registered businesses that:\n\n(a) Have complex corporate structures and business models and/or voluminous transactions;\n\n(b) Place emphasis on tax risk management as part of their corporate governance; and\n\n(c) Rely on extensive in-built controls in their systems and processes to generate timely and accurate data for financial and tax reporting.\n\nYou have to notify IRAS of your intention to participate in the ACAP by submitting the form \u201cGST F23 \u2013 Participation in GST Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP)\u201d prior to commencement of ACAP Review. IRAS will review your application and approve your participation if you fulfilled all eligibility conditions.\n\nYou and your ACAP Reviewer must follow the methodology set out in the \u201cGST ACAP Review Guidance\u201d. You have a period of 15 months to submit to IRAS the ACAP findings (i.e. \u201cACAP Factual Report\u201d and other deliverables).\n\nYou will be accorded an ACAP status if you attain certain benchmarks in the level of controls. Accordingly, you will enjoy a range of benefits when you are accorded an ACAP status.\n\nIn gist, the ACAP process is a 4-step process as follows:\n\n1. Getting Ready for ACAP Review\n2.

        "summary": "**Summary of the Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP) for GST**\n\nThe Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP) is a voluntary compliance initiative designed for GST-registered businesses to enhance their internal controls and improve GST compliance. The program involves a comprehensive, risk-based review of GST controls to ensure accurate GST return filings.\n\n**Key Components of ACAP:**\n\n1. **Self-Review of GST Controls:**\n   - Businesses must complete a checklist to assess GST controls at three levels: Entity, Transaction, and GST Reporting.\n   - The aim is to identify and address GST risks, ensuring controls meet or exceed IRAS' minimum standards.\n\n2. **ACAP Review:**\n   - After self-assessment, businesses engage an independent ACAP Reviewer, approved by IRAS, to conduct a thorough review.\n   - The Reviewer evaluates the effectiveness of GST controls and identifies any gaps or errors in past GST returns.\n\n3. **Proactive Review and Monitoring:**\n   - If the Reviewer confirms effective controls, businesses receive an ACAP status, which requires ongoing monitoring of GST risk management processes.\n   - Businesses must perform a Post ACAP Review (PAR) to ensure continued compliance and can renew their ACAP status before it expires.\n\n**Eligibility Criteria:**\nTo participate in ACAP, businesses must:\n- Have a proactive GST risk management framework with established controls.\n- Have audited financial statements with an unqualified opinion.\n- Be GST-registered for at least three years and maintain good compliance records.\n- Not be under any current GST audit by IRAS.\n\n**Benefits of ACAP Status:**\nBusinesses awarded ACAP status (either 'ACAP Premium' for 5 years or 'ACAP Merit' for 3 years) enjoy several benefits, including:\n- Reduced IRAS compliance activities unless significant issues arise.\n- Faster GST refunds and handling of GST rulings.\n- Auto-renewal of applicable GST schemes.\n\n**Error Disclosure and Penalty Waiver:**\nIf errors are found during the ACAP Review, businesses can disclose these errors voluntarily. IRAS offers a one-time waiver of penalties for non-fraudulent errors if businesses settle additional taxes and achieve ACAP status.\n\n**Review Arrangements:**\nACAP Reviews can be conducted by:\n- Public Accounting Entities (PAE) or their tax affiliates.\n- In-house Internal Audit teams.\n- A combination of both.\n\n**Post-Review Obligations:**\nBusinesses must conduct two PARs during the validity of their ACAP status and submit documentation to IRAS. Failure to comply with conditions may lead to revocation of ACAP status.\n\n**Renewal and Transfer of ACAP Status:**\nBusinesses can renew their ACAP status before expiration, with a less intensive review process. ACAP status is generally non-transferable but may be retained under specific conditions.\n\nIn summary, ACAP provides a structured approach for GST-registered businesses to enhance compliance and manage GST risks while offering benefits for maintaining robust internal controls.",

        "text": "GST: Renewal of Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP) Status\n\nThis e-Tax guide is applicable to GST-registered businesses accorded with ACAP status. It provides details of the renewal process of ACAP status and the scope of ACAP Renewal Review. Businesses are encouraged to renew their ACAP status.\n\nYou should read this e-Tax guide if you are:\n\n(a) A GST-registered business which intends to undergo an ACAP Renewal Review to renew your ACAP status; or\n\n(b) An ACAP Reviewer appointed by a GST-registered business to conduct the ACAP Renewal Review.\n\nGST-registered businesses that have undertaken rigorous ACAP review through independent ACAP Reviewers are accorded with either an \u2018ACAP Premium\u2019 or \u2018ACAP Merit\u2019 status, with a validity period of 5 years and 3 years respectively. This award recognises their commitment to proactively manage their GST risks through effective GST controls established at Entity, Transaction and GST Reporting levels. As Approved ACAP Businesses, they enjoy benefits such as step-down of IRAS-GST compliance activities, faster GST refunds, faster response to ruling requests and auto-renewal of GST schemes, if applicable.\n\nBusinesses intending to renew their ACAP status should initiate the process at the start of the last year of their ACAP status. They have to engage an independent reviewer to conduct a review of their past GST returns filed in a 12-month period (\u201cReview Year\u201d). The findings are to be submitted within 3 months after the expiry date of their ACAP status.\n\nOn account that businesses have established a GST Control Framework to secure continual GST compliance and conducted Post ACAP Review (\u201cPAR\u201d) during their ACAP status validity period, the scope of ACAP Renewal Review is less intensive than the first-time ACAP review. The key differences are as follows:\n\n(a) The Test Period for the conduct of review testing is reduced to 3 months (from 6 months for first-time ACAP Review).\n\n(b) Walk-through is required only on tax classification controls instead of the entire transaction process.\n\n(c) Tests of controls are required only if there are new or major changes to business processes (e.g. outsourcing, new accounting software) since the last PAR.\n\n(d) A lower sample size to conduct substantive review of documents.\n\n(e) The \u201cACAP Renewal Report\u201d is simplified and only requires ACAP Reviewer to provide salient information on their findings. Submission of the process documentation is optional.\n\nThis scope of review was designed in consultation with selected businesses accorded with ACAP status and existing ACAP Reviewers.\n\nThe ACAP Renewal process comprises 3 key segments:\n\n1. Self-Review of GST Controls\n\nComplete the \u201cSelf-Review of GST Controls checklists\u201d (\"SRC\") to assess if your GST controls are established at three levels (Entity, Transaction and GST Reporting) to ensure continual GST compliance.\n\nExamine if the design and application of your GST controls are adequate to address GST risks of filing incorrect GST returns though your GST control framework may have met IRAS' minimum acceptable standard of an established GST control framework for ACAP Renewal.\n\n2. Commence ACAP Renewal Review and Implement Additional Controls\n\nFollowing your self-assessment of the effectiveness of your GST controls, you may participate in the ACAP Renewal Review by engaging an independent ACAP Reviewer screened by IRAS to conduct a holistic review of your GST controls using the ACAP Renewal Review methodology set out in the \u201cGST ACAP Renewal Review Guidance\u201d.\n\nThe ACAP Reviewer will conduct an independent review of the effectiveness of your GST controls using its professional auditing methodology and in accordance with the ACAP Renewal Review methodology.\n\nBased on the ACAP Reviewer\u2019s findings, you will evaluate the impact of any GST gaps identified and errors made in your past and current GST returns and take active steps to improve your existing controls.\n\n3. Proactive Review of GST Risks and Monitoring\n\nIRAS will renew your ACAP status if you demonstrate that the GST controls established at all three levels (Entity, Transaction and GST Reporting) are working effectively, based on the findings of the ACAP Reviewer.\n\nDuring the validity period of your ACAP status, you will continue to review and monitor the effectiveness of your GST risk management process from internal and external changes. You will also be required to provide assurance of your oversight on GST matters to ensure continuous GST compliance by performing the Post ACAP Review (\u201cPAR\u201d).\n\nYou are encouraged to renew your ACAP status prior to the expiry date of your ACAP status in lieu of the second PAR. Renewing your ACAP status assures your stakeholders of the sustainability and robustness of your GST risk management process in the filing of correct GST returns on an ongoing basis.\n\nGlossary\n\nACAP: Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme\n\nACAP Renewal Applicant (\u201cARA\u201d): A GST-registered business which is approved by IRAS to participate in ACAP Renewal.\n\nACAP Renewal Review: An independent review performed by an ACAP Reviewer covering a 12-month Review Year. The ACAP Reviewer conducts the review on the effectiveness of the ARA\u2019s GST controls in mitigating risks of filing incorrect GST return and ascertain if it fulfills IRAS\u2019 GST Control framework based on the ACAP Renewal Review methodology set out in the \u201cGST ACAP Renewal Review Guidance\u201d.\n\nACAP Reviewer: Public Accounting Entity (\u201cPAE\u201d) and/or its tax affiliate with a track record in conducting audit and/or GST return reviews of large businesses. An ARA\u2019s internal audit team that reports directly to an independent Audit Committee may also be considered.\n\nACAP Status: A status awarded to an ARA which completed the ACAP Renewal Review and meets the IRAS\u2019 ACAP standard. Depending on the scores obtained, the ARA may be awarded either an \u2018ACAP Premium\u2019 or \u2018ACAP Merit\u2019.\n\nApproved ACAP Business: An ACAP Renewal Applicant (\u201cARA\u201d) awarded with either an \u2018ACAP Premium\u2019 or \u2018ACAP Merit\u2019 status.\n\nPost ACAP Review (\u201cPAR\u201d): A review performed by an Approved ACAP Business following the renewal of ACAP status. The first review must be submitted within 18 months from IRAS\u2019 notification of the approval of the renewed ACAP status, and the second review must be submitted 6 months before the expiry date of the renewed ACAP status.\n\nReview Year: The 12-month period covered by the GST returns selected for ACAP Renewal Review.\n\nRenewal Grace Period: One year from the statutory filing date of the last GST return in respect of the Review Year.\n\nTest Period: A 3-month period from the Review Year selected by the ACAP Reviewer to perform review testing for ACAP Renewal Review.\n\nOverview of ACAP Renewal Process\n\nBusinesses accorded with ACAP status will be invited to renew their ACAP status 15 months before the expiry date of their ACAP status.\n\nOnce they have self-assessed that they fulfil the eligibility conditions listed in this e-Tax guide, they should complete and submit the form \u201cGST F29 - Application to Renew ACAP Status\u201d within 3 months from the invitation letter.\n\nUpon IRAS\u2019 acceptance of the ACAP Renewal Applicants\u2019 (\u201cARAs\u201d) applications, they have to submit the ACAP Renewal Declaration and deliverables within 3 months after the expiry date of the ACAP status.\n\nUpon receipt and review of the ACAP Renewal Declaration, IRAS may seek clarification on the ACAP Reviewer\u2019s findings. IRAS may also request to sight the working papers.\n\nARAs\u2019 ACAP status will be renewed for 6 years from the expiry date of the original ACAP status if they are accorded the \u2018ACAP Premium\u2019 status. If they are accorded the \u2018ACAP Merit\u2019 status, their ACAP status will be renewed for 4 years. They will enjoy the benefits highlighted in this e-Tax guide.\n\nIn gist, the ACAP Renewal process is a 4-step process as follows:\n\n1. Getting Ready for ACAP Renewal Review\n\nFollowing the accord or renewal of ACAP Status, the GST-registered business should continue to maintain the key controls in the \u201cSelf-Review of GST Controls checklists\" (\u201cSRC\u201d) and obtain a score of at least 60% for Entity, Transaction and GST Reporting levels.\n\nThe GST-registered business is to self-assess the score of its GST Control Framework at each level by completing the SRC. The business should also identify changes in its business processes that could affect the overall effectiveness of its GST controls, identify significant events and changes in business activities since the last Post ACAP Review (\u201cPAR\u201d) to assess if the risks are managed, decide on an ACAP Renewal arrangement and appoint an ACAP Reviewer, where applicable.\n\nThe business is to notify IRAS of its intention to participate in ACAP Renewal by submitting the form \u201cGST F29 - Application to Renew ACAP status\u201d and may proceed to commence the ACAP Renewal Review following IRAS\u2019 approval. Thereafter, the approved participant is termed as the \u201cACAP Renewal Applicant\u201d (\u201cARA\u201d).\n\n2. Commencement of ACAP Renewal Review\n\nFor the purpose of the ACAP Renewal Review, the ARA is required to:\n\n(i) Select a 12-month period based on the latest 12 months of GST returns filed at the time of the commencement of review (i.e. Review Year); and identify and review anomalies in the GST declarations for the Review Year.\n\n(ii) The ARA must present all critical information to the ACAP Reviewer, on its business profile and processes from tax classification at source to submission of its GST returns and proactive risks review and monitoring process.\n\n(iii) ARA and ACAP Reviewer must agree on the ACAP Renewal Review audit schedule and resource commitment to ensure that ACAP Renewal Report is submitted to IRAS by the due date. The due date is within 3 months after the expiry of ACAP status.\n\n3. Consolidate and Submit ACAP Renewal Deliverables to IRAS\n\nIRAS will review the submitted ACAP Renewal Report and renew the ACAP status only for eligible ARAs.\n\nEligibility Conditions to Renew ACAP Status\n\nTo be eligible for participation in ACAP Renewal, ARA should meet all the following conditions:\n\n(a) ARA has established proactive GST risk management by having a GST Control Framework encompassing preventive and detective GST controls at the Entity, Transaction and GST Reporting levels to ensure filing of accurate GST returns.\n\n(b) ARA has continued to maintain all key controls listed in the \u201cSelf-Review of GST Controls checklists\u201d (\u201cSRC\u201d) for the three levels (i.e. Entity, Transaction and GST Reporting) and obtained a total score of at least 60%.\n\n(c) The ARA\u2019s latest financial statements have been audited and the auditor\u2019s opinion is unqualified.\n\n(d) ARA is currently not under any GST audit conducted by IRAS.\n\n(e) ARA has good compliance records for GST, Income Tax, Property Tax, Withholding Tax (including no tax outstanding with IRAS) and with the Singapore Customs.\n\n(f) ARA has committed to appoint a qualified ACAP Reviewer to conduct ACAP Renewal Review.\n\nBenefits of Renewing ACAP Status\n\nUpon acceptance of the application for ACAP Renewal, IRAS will waive the requirement for ARA to perform the second PAR, which is due 6 months before the expiry date of ACAP status.\n\nThe following benefits will be accorded to ARA with \u2018ACAP Premium\u2019 status for 6 years or \u2018ACAP Merit\u2019 status for 4 years:\n\n(a) Step-down of IRAS-GST compliance activities unless significant anomalies are noted in GST return declarations and/or there are increased risks in the wrong GST treatment adopted due to major GST policy changes;\n\n(b) Expeditious GST refunds, if no anomalies are noted;\n\n(c) Dedicated team to handle GST Rulings and resolve GST issues expeditiously;\n\n(d) Auto-renewal of the GST schemes (e.g. Major Exporter Scheme (\u201cMES\u201d), Import GST Deferment Scheme (\u201cIGDS\u201d), Approved Contract Manufacturer and Trader Scheme (\u201cACMT\u201d)), if applicable; and\n\n(e) Zero or reduced penalties under IRAS\u2019 Voluntary Disclosure Programme (\u201cVDP\u201d) for past GST errors disclosed on a timely basis to IRAS.\n\nErrors Discovered in the Course of ACAP Renewal Review\n\nIRAS will waive the 5% late payment penalty for GST errors that occurred in the Review Year if the voluntary disclosure is made within one year from the statutory filing date of the last GST return of the Review Year.\n\nFor GST errors that occurred prior to the Review Year, 5% late payment penalty will be waived if the disclosure is made within one year from the statutory filing date of the respective returns in which the errors occurred.\n\nThe above will apply provided that the GST errors do not involve wilful intent and the qualifying conditions stated in the e-Tax Guide \u201cIRAS\u2019 Voluntary Disclosure Programme\u201d are met.\n\nVarious Arrangements to Conduct ACAP Renewal Review\n\nACAP Renewal Review may be conducted based on any of the following 3 arrangements:\n\nArrangement 1: By Public Accounting Entity (\"PAE\") or its tax affiliate\n\nArrangement 2: By independent in-house Internal Audit (\"IA\") team\n\nArrangement 3: Jointly by in-house IA team and a PAE\n\nArrangement 1: ACAP Renewal Review is conducted by a Public Accounting Entity (\u201cPAE\u201d) or its tax affiliate\n\nA PAE or its tax affiliate is appointed by the ARA to perform the entire ACAP Renewal Review. The designated team to conduct the ACAP Renewal Review fulfills the following conditions:\n\n(a) The team is led by an Accredited Tax Advisor (GST) of Singapore Chartered Tax Professionals Limited (\u201cSCTP\u201d).\n\n(b) The team reports to an Audit Partner or Tax Partner/Tax Director.\n\n(c) The team\u2019s tests of controls follow the audit methodology based on generally accepted auditing standards.\n\n(d) If the PAE or its tax affiliate had been involved in other GST-specific engagements listed below, it should put in place additional safeguards (other than the usual safeguards required by the profession):\n\nGST-specific engagement: Additional safeguards in the conduct of ACAP Renewal Review\n\nIf the PAE or its tax affiliate prepares or reviews GST return for the ARA prior to e-filing of the return: The 12-month Review Year should not coincide with the same period for which return was prepared or the GST reviewed.\n\nIf the PAE or its tax affiliate designs and/or documents the GST process flows of the ARA: If the periods coincide, the firm should assign an entirely different team to undertake the ACAP Renewal Review. The staff involved in the design and documentation of the GST process flows must not be a member of the ACAP Renewal Review team.\n\nFor PAEs or tax affiliates which are first-time ACAP Reviewers, IRAS would conduct screening to be assured of the firms\u2019 capability in conducting the ACAP Renewal Review. The screening review is necessary as the ACAP Reviewer\u2019s professional judgement and findings in the conduct of the ACAP Renewal Review is a critical aspect of the programme. Hence, prior to commencing an ACAP Renewal Review for its client, the firm is required to write in to IRAS to request for a screening review.\n\nArrangement 2: ACAP Renewal Review is conducted by an Independent In-House Internal Audit (\u201cIA\u201d) team\n\nACAP Renewal Review is conducted independently by the ARA\u2019s in-house Internal Audit (\u201cIA\u201d) team. The IA team in charge of ACAP Renewal Review must fulfill the following conditions:\n\n(a) The team lead is a member of a professional accounting or auditing body.\n\n(b) At least one member in the team is an Accredited Tax Practitioner (GST) or Accredited Tax Advisor (GST) of SCTP.\n\n(c) The team reports directly to the Audit Committee comprising all independent non-executive directors; or reports to a committee specifically tasked by the senior management to oversee the review independently and the committee reports its findings to AC.\n\n(d) If the ACAP Renewal Review is performed by a global IA team, the global IA team has similar set-up in reporting to an overseas AC comprising all non-executive directors.\n\nArrangement 3: ACAP Renewal Review is conducted jointly by in-house IA team and a PAE\n\nA PAE is engaged to conduct ACAP Renewal Review jointly with the ARA\u2019s in-house IA team. The composition of the team members may vary depending on the ARA\u2019s needs. If the lead ACAP Reviewer is from the PAE, he/she must fulfill the conditions under Arrangement 1. If the lead ACAP Reviewer is from the IA team, he/she must fulfill the conditions under Arrangement 2.\n\nAfter Renewal of ACAP Status\n\nFollowing the renewal of ACAP status, there are certain obligations that an Approved ACAP Business is required to fulfil to provide assurance of the ongoing effectiveness of its GST controls in managing the GST risks of its business. In addition, there may be changes to its business circumstances that could impact the effectiveness of its GST controls as represented during the ACAP Renewal Review. The subsequent paragraphs outline these obligations including the impact to its ACAP status arising from changes to its business.\n\nMonitoring and review during the validity period of ACAP status\n\nDuring the validity period of the renewed ACAP status, Approved ACAP Businesses have to perform two Post ACAP Reviews (\u201cPAR\u201d) as a quality assurance of their effective oversight on GST matters and the accuracy of GST returns submitted.\n\nThe PAR performed must be documented via form \u201cGST F28 - Post Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP) Review Declaration\u201d and substantiated with working papers on the samples reviewed. The Approved ACAP Businesses are required to submit the form GST F28 to IRAS.\n\nThe first PAR must be submitted within 18 months from IRAS\u2019 notification of the approval of the renewed ACAP status and the second PAR must be submitted 6 months before the expiry date of the renewed ACAP status. However, if the Approved ACAP Businesses continue to renew their ACAP status, they will be exempted from conducting the second PAR.\n\nIf the Approved ACAP Businesses are not renewing their ACAP status and are under any existing GST scheme (e.g. Major Exporter Scheme (\u201cMES\u201d), Import GST Deferment Scheme (\u201cIGDS\u201d), Approved Contract Manufacturer and Trader Scheme (\u201cACMT\u201d)), the second PAR must be performed or certified by an Accredited Tax Practitioner or Advisor (GST) of SCTP. It must be documented via form \u201cGST F28A \u2013 Certified Post ACAP Review Declaration\u201d and submitted 6 months before the expiry date of the renewed ACAP status.\n\nAny voluntary disclosure of errors under PAR may enjoy waiver of penalties or reduced penalties if the errors are disclosed within the 1-year grace period under IRAS\u2019 VDP guidelines. Where there are serious control-related errors that impact the effectiveness of the Approved ACAP Businesses\u2019 GST Control Framework, IRAS will impose additional requirements on the Approved ACAP Businesses to retain their ACAP status.\n\nRevocation of ACAP status\n\nIRAS may revoke the ACAP status awarded to an Approved ACAP Business due to certain circumstances that arise subsequently. There could also be situations where IRAS may allow the transfer or retention of an Approved ACAP Business\u2019 ACAP status due to changes in business circumstances.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing the Review Year?\n\nYour choice of Review Year may affect the time period available to complete and submit the ACAP Renewal Declaration and deliverables and period for which penalties would be waived.\n\nCan I apply for renewal after expiry of ACAP status?\n\nNo. It will be treated as a new application where ACAP Review scope is the same as a first time ACAP applicant. It is not advisable to delay your application for renewal of ACAP status as additional costs would be incurred. This is because you are required to submit the second PAR which is due 6 months before the expiry date of your ACAP status. If you are applying for GST scheme, you are required to obtain a certified Post ACAP Review (\u201cPAR\u201d). In addition, as the scope of ACAP Renewal Review is simplified, you would expect to expend fewer resources. Since you have already embarked on your GST risk management journey, continuing to be an Approved ACAP Business provides you the assurance that robust tax risk management is in place to ensure long term compliance.\n\nDo I need to perform PAR after renewal of ACAP status?\n\nYes, Approved ACAP Businesses are required to perform two PARs during the ACAP status validity period after renewal.\n\nContact information\n\nFor enquiries on this e-Tax Guide and Appendices, please contact the Goods and Services Tax Division at https://www.iras.gov.sg (select \u201cContact Us\u201d).\n\nUpdates and Amendments\n\nDate of amendment: 29 Oct 2019\n\nAmendments made: Editorial changes, amended paragraph 3 to include independent in-house Internal Audit team in the definition of ACAP Reviewer, amended section 1.15 and inserted footnote 18, 19 and 20, amended section 1.23 and inserted footnote 23 and 24, amended section 2.4(b) and 2.7(c), inserted section 3.2(a)(vi) - (viii), amended section 3.3(c), 3.5 and 3.8(a), inserted section 4.4(d) and 4.5, amended section 5.1, inserted section 5.3(d), 5.3(g), 5.3(h) and 5.3(i) and footnote 31, amended section 5.3(e), inserted section 5.4(b), (c), (e) and (f), amended section 5.5, 5.7, 5.11 and inserted footnote 35, amended section 7.3(b).\n\nAppendix 2 \u2013 Information Leaflet on Post ACAP Review (PAR) after ACAP Renewal\n\nCompetent team to conduct the PAR\n\nApproved ACAP Businesses may choose to use their in-house team or engage an external consultant (e.g. Public Accounting Entity, GST advisory firm) to conduct the review of their past GST declarations. The senior management should ensure that the team is sufficiently resourced and competent in conducting the review. The results of the review are to be highlighted to the Audit Committee/Board of Directors.\n\nIn-house team: The team leader must have in-depth GST knowledge of GST rules for both general and industry issues and is preferably an Accredited Tax Practitioner (GST) or Accredited Tax Advisor (GST) of Singapore Chartered Tax Professionals Limited (SCTP). He/she should have good overall knowledge of the financial and accounting system and processes as well as GST tax classification and control processes. The tax team/internal audit team (whichever is applicable) should be involved in the review.\n\nThe team should report to the key person tasked with overall responsibility for GST compliance (such as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer, Finance Director and Head of Finance).\n\nExternal Consultant: The team leader must be an ATA (GST) or ATP (GST) of SCTP. The firm should have prior experience in conducting GST compliance reviews for businesses of similar size and in the same industry.\n\nScope of review\n\nThe following aspects should be covered in the PAR:\n\n(a) Review anomalies in the past one year\u2019s GST return declarations and compare against the financial statements or management accounts to detect errors.\n\n(b) Select a 3-month period of GST declarations, assessed to pose higher risks of errors (e.g. period where there is a change of key finance staff, major change of business processes and accounting systems and other events that impact GST reporting) or have higher values of transactions.\n\n(c) Review the GST listings of transactions for the selected period to identify potential errors. Some examples of potential errors include:\n\n(i) Recurrence of errors or control gaps surfaced during the conduct of ACAP Review and/or ACAP Renewal Review\n\n(ii) Omitted sales (e.g. missing sales invoices) and not adhering to time of supply rules\n\n(iii) Wrong interpretation of disbursement and reimbursement\n\n(iv) Omission to deem output tax on gifts of goods\n\n(v) Duplicate input tax claims\n\n(vi) Claiming of disallowed input tax\n\n(vii) Failure to repay input tax on purchases that remain unpaid after 12 months from the payment due date\n\n(viii) Data extraction error\n\n(ix) Other GST risks as highlighted in Appendix 4 of this e-Tax Guide\n\n(d) Perform substantive review of transactions for the selected period. The samples selected should cover major income and expenditure streams and exceptional transactions to check for value accuracy, correctness of GST treatment and whether the transaction is supported with required documentary evidence.\n\nApproved ACAP Businesses with no prior experience in performing in-house tax reviews or require further guidance on the review scope can adopt the review methodology covered in the step-by-step guidance in the e-Tax Guide \u201cGST: Assisted Self-Help Kit (ASK) Annual Review Guide\u201d.\n\nBusiness updates and assessment of the impact on GST controls\n\nThe team should review the correspondence or corporate management files (if applicable) to identify events or business activities that could pose a risk to the business\u2019 GST compliance.\n\nThe team should seek feedback from the various heads of functional units on any updates of business models/contracts or processes that could affect the effectiveness of the GST controls.\n\nSuch updates would enable the team to assess whether the GST process flows need to be updated, including the database containing important information of business\u2019 stance towards proactive GST risk management.\n\nFor new risk areas, the business has to assess the need to re-complete the \u201cSelf-Review of GST Controls checklists\u201d (\u201cSRC\u201d) and seek a ruling from IRAS for contentious tax issues to secure tax certainty.\n\nReview of new processes\n\nThis procedure is required if there are new or major changes to business model and GST control process since the last ACAP Review or PAR submitted to IRAS.\n\nThe team should assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the controls established based on the GST Control Practices compiled in the \u201cSelf-Review of GST Controls checklists\u201d (\u201cSRC\u201d) as part of the \u201cGST ACAP Renewal Review Guidance\u201d. Alternatively, if the team has identified additional controls that enable it to better manage its GST risks, it may evaluate if they are working effectively.\n\nThe review of controls on new processes should include if staff has applied correct tax treatment at source.\n\nReview period for PAR after ACAP Renewal\n\nThe Approved ACAP Business must determine a 12-month review period and select a 3-month period of GST declarations to conduct the PAR. The 12-month review period for each PAR and the respective submission due dates are as follows:\n\nFirst PAR via \u201cGST F28 - PAR Declaration\u201d: Latest 12 months of GST returns filed from IRAS\u2019 notification of renewal of ACAP status. Due date to submit PAR is 18 months from IRAS\u2019 notification of your renewed ACAP status.\n\nSecond PAR via form \u201cGST F28 - PAR Declaration\u201d: Latest 12 months of GST returns filed as at the end of the 5th year (for \u2018ACAP Premium\u2019 status) or 3rd year (for \u2018ACAP Merit\u2019 status) of the renewed ACAP status validity period. Due date to submit PAR is 6 months before the expiry of the renewed ACAP status.\n\nAn Approved ACAP Business that continues to renew its ACAP status will be exempted from the second PAR.\n\nSubmission of first and second PAR\n\nThe Approved ACAP Business is required to submit the form GST F28 and the following documents:\n\nFirst PAR via form \u201cGST F28 - PAR Declaration\u201d:\n\n- Appendix 1 - Trend Analysis\n- Appendix 2 - Disclosure of Errors in GST Returns and Follow-Up Actions (if applicable)\n\nSecond PAR via form \u201cGST F28 - PAR Declaration\u201d:\n\n- Appendix 1 - Trend Analysis\n- Appendix 2 - Disclosure of Errors in GST Returns and Follow-Up Actions (if applicable)\n- Appendix 3 - Working Template for Standard-Rated Supplies and Output Tax\n- Appendix 4 - Working Template for Zero-Rated Supplies\n- Appendix 5.1 - Working Template for Exempt Supplies (if the business is actively making exempt supplies) or Appendix 5.2 - Working Template for Exempt Supplies (for other business)\n- Appendix 6 - Working Template for Input Tax and Refund Claimed (on Local Purchases, Imports with GST Paid, Tourist Refund Scheme and Bad Debt Relief)\n- Appendix 7.1 - Working Template for Imports with GST Suspended (e.g. under MES) or with GST Deferred (under IGDS) (for own imports)\n- Appendix 7.2 - Working Template for Imports with GST Suspended (e.g. under MES) or with GST Deferred (under IGDS) (for goods imported on behalf of overseas principals)\n\nRegular review of the GST returns\n\nAlthough the PAR is not required to be performed annually, we strongly encourage Approved ACAP Businesses to perform regular reviews of their GST declarations to qualify for waiver of penalties for errors disclosed within the 1-year grace period under IRAS\u2019 VDP. Any delay in disclosing or rectifying the errors would result in late payment penalties being imposed if the errors are disclosed or the GST F7 return is filed beyond the 1-year grace period.\n\nAppendix 3: Information Leaflet on Certified Post ACAP Review (PAR) (For GST Scheme Renewal \u2013 If you do not continue to renew your ACAP status)\n\nCompetent team to conduct the PAR\n\nThe Second Certified PAR must either be:\n\n(a) Performed by external Accredited Tax Advisor (GST) or Accredited Tax Practitioner (GST) of Singapore Chartered Tax Professionals Limited (SCTP); or\n\n(b) Performed by in-house ATA (GST) or ATP (GST) accredited with SCTP; or\n\n(c) Performed in-house and certified by external ATA (GST) or ATP (GST) accredited with SCTP, adhering to the certification procedures set out in the e-Tax Guide \u201cGST: Assisted Self-Help Kit (ASK) Annual Review Guide\u201d.\n\nScope of review of Certified PAR and sample size\n\nThe review must be conducted based on the ASK methodology and adhere to the sample size requirements specified in the e-Tax Guide \u201cGST: ASK Annual Review Guide\u201d.\n\nFurther, the team should ensure that the following additional aspects are covered in the PAR:\n\n(a) Review of past GST errors and control gaps surfaced during the conduct of ACAP Review, ACAP Renewal Review and past PAR.\n\n(b) Review potential GST risk areas highlighted in IRAS\u2019 letter upon the accord of ACAP status.\n\n(c) Identify events or business activities that could pose new GST risk to the Approved ACAP Business\u2019 GST compliance.\n\n(d) Seek feedback from the various heads of functional units on any updates of business models/contracts or processes that could affect the effectiveness of the GST controls. The team should assess whether the GST process flows need to be updated, including the database containing important information of business\u2019 stance towards proactive GST risk management.\n\n(e) Describe the changes made to the GST controls established to ensure correct tax classification applied and accuracy in value.\n\n(f) Describe the follow-up action taken to ensure that GST risks are managed.\n\nThe team is required to record the results of its checks in the working templates of the form GST F28A \u201cCertified Post ACAP Review Declaration\u201d.\n\nPeriod of review\n\nThe Certified PAR should be performed based on the latest 12 months of GST returns filed as at the end of the 5th year (for \u2018ACAP Premium\u2019 status) or 3rd year (for \u2018ACAP Merit\u2019 status) of the renewed ACAP status validity period.\n\nSubmission of PAR findings\n\nThe following must be submitted together with the form GST F28A six months before the expiry of the renewed ACAP status:\n\nFor Certified PAR performed by SCTP ATA (GST)/ATP (GST):\n\n(a) Appendix 1 - Trend Analysis\n\n(b) Appendix 2 - Disclosure of Errors in GST Returns and Follow-Up Actions (if applicable)\n\n(c) Appendix 3 - Working Template for Standard-Rated Supplies and Output Tax\n\n(d) Appendix 4 - Working Template for Zero-Rated Supplies\n\n(e) Appendix 5.1 - Working Template for Exempt Supplies (if the business is actively making exempt supplies) or Appendix 5.2 - Working Template for Exempt Supplies (for other business)\n\n(f) Appendix 6 - Working Template for Input Tax and Refund Claimed (on Local Purchases, Imports with GST Paid, Tourist Refund Scheme and Bad Debt Relief)\n\n(g) Appendix 7.1 - Working Template for Imports with GST Suspended (e.g. under MES) or with GST Deferred (under IGDS) (for own imports)\n\n(h) Appendix 7.2 - Working Template for Imports with GST Suspended (e.g. under MES) or with GST Deferred (under IGDS) (for goods imported on behalf of overseas principals)\n\nPlease refer to paragraph 13 of this e-Tax Guide for the links to download the above templates.\n\nIRAS reserves the right to verify and extend the scope of audit checks beyond the samples selected by businesses which have performed the checks according to the e-Tax Guide \u201cGST: ASK Annual Review Guide\u201d. If additional errors are detected during the course of IRAS\u2019 audit, they would not qualify for waiver or reduced penalty under IRAS\u2019 Voluntary Disclosure Programme (\u201cVDP\u201d).\n\nAppendix 4: Common GST Risks at Transaction and GST Reporting Level\n\nThe ARA/Approved ACAP Business and ACAP Reviewer should consider any GST risks including those listed below that could be applicable to the business and include them in its review tests.

        "summary": "**Summary of GST: Renewal of ACAP Status**\n\nThe e-Tax guide outlines the renewal process for the Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme (ACAP) status for GST-registered businesses. ACAP status is awarded to businesses that demonstrate effective GST risk management through established controls at the entity, transaction, and reporting levels. There are two levels of ACAP status: \u2018ACAP Premium\u2019 (valid for 5 years) and \u2018ACAP Merit\u2019 (valid for 3 years), which offer benefits such as reduced compliance activities, expedited GST refunds, and auto-renewal of GST schemes.\n\n**Eligibility for Renewal:**\nTo renew ACAP status, businesses must:\n1. Maintain a proactive GST Control Framework.\n2. Score at least 60% on the Self-Review of GST Controls checklists.\n3. Have unqualified audited financial statements.\n4. Not be under any GST audit by IRAS.\n5. Have a good compliance record with tax obligations.\n6. Appoint a qualified ACAP Reviewer.\n\n**Renewal Process:**\nThe renewal process involves three main steps:\n1. **Self-Review of GST Controls:** Businesses assess their GST controls using checklists.\n2. **ACAP Renewal Review:** Engage an independent ACAP Reviewer to conduct a review of GST controls over a 12-month Review Year.\n3. **Proactive Review of GST Risks:** Demonstrate ongoing effectiveness of GST controls based on the Reviewer\u2019s findings.\n\n**Key Differences in Renewal Review:**\n- The Test Period for review is reduced to 3 months.\n- Focus is primarily on tax classification controls.\n- A lower sample size is required for document review.\n- The ACAP Renewal Report is simplified.\n\n**Benefits of Renewing ACAP Status:**\n- Waiver of the second Post ACAP Review (PAR).\n- Reduced compliance activities unless significant anomalies are noted.\n- Faster GST refunds and dedicated handling of GST issues.\n- Waiver of late payment penalties for errors disclosed within a specified timeframe.\n\n**Post ACAP Review (PAR):**\nApproved ACAP Businesses must perform two PARs during the validity of their ACAP status. The first PAR is due within 18 months of renewal, and the second is due 6 months before the expiry of the renewed status. If the business continues to renew its ACAP status, the second PAR is exempted.\n\n**Common GST Risks:**\nThe guide highlights various GST risks at the transaction and reporting levels, including incorrect tax classification, data entry errors, and failure to adhere to GST scheme conditions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBusinesses are encouraged to renew their ACAP status before expiry to ensure continued benefits and demonstrate robust GST risk management practices. The renewal process is designed to be less intensive for businesses that have previously established effective controls.",

        "text": "GST: Fringe Benefits\n\nThis guide explains the GST treatment for goods and services provided by you (a GST-registered person) to your employees as fringe benefits. Specifically, it explains when you are allowed to claim the GST incurred on fringe benefits and whether you are required to account for GST when these benefits are given free to your employees.\n\nFringe benefits refer to non-wage benefits provided by employers to their employees. These benefits are given to employees as part of their overall remuneration packages and can take the form of either goods or services.\n\nYou can claim input tax incurred on fringe benefits provided that the fringe benefits are incurred for the purpose of your business. All fringe benefits contain elements of personal consumption on which GST should be levied. As such, the Comptroller will consider them as incurred for the purpose of your business only if they have a close nexus to your business activities. In addition, the benefits must not be disallowed under regulations 26 and 27 of the GST (General) Regulations.\n\nIf you have been allowed the input tax claim, you may need to account for output tax when you give away business goods as gifts to your employees or let your employees temporarily use the goods for their personal use, even if no consideration is charged.\n\nFor services provided free to your employees, you are not required to account for output tax.\n\nYou are entitled to claim input tax for the GST charged on goods and services if you satisfy all the following conditions:\n\n(i) You are GST-registered;\n(ii) The goods or services must have been supplied to you. For imported goods, the goods must have been imported by you;\n(iii) The goods or services are used or to be used for the purpose of your business;\n(iv) The goods or services must be used for the making of taxable supplies (i.e. standard-rated or zero-rated supplies) or out-of-scope supplies which would be taxable supplies if made in Singapore;\n(v) The input tax claims are not disallowed under regulations 26 and 27 of the GST (General) Regulations; and\n(vi) You have taken reasonable steps to ascertain and concluded that the goods or services were not part of a Missing Trader Fraud arrangement and the conclusion is one that a reasonable person would have made.\n\nTo claim input tax for the GST incurred on goods or services, the supply must be contractually made to you. Where the tax invoice issued by the supplier is addressed to you, the Comptroller will, prima facie, treat the supply as contractually made to you.\n\nWhere the tax invoice is addressed to your employee, you may claim the GST incurred as your input tax provided that your employee is acting as your agent in receiving the supply of goods or services.\n\nWhere the supply of fringe benefits is clearly contracted in your employee\u2019s name, such as for mobile phone plans, memberships with a professional body and educational courses, your employee is unlikely to be acting as your agent when he receives the supply of goods or services. Nonetheless, as an administrative concession, the Comptroller will allow you to claim input tax for the expenses provided that:\n\n(i) Your employee is reimbursed; and\n(ii) The expenses are recognised as business expenses in your accounts.\n\nIf you reimburse your employee partially, you can only claim the GST in proportion to the reimbursed amount. For example, your employee incurred $65.40 (including GST) on mobile phone expenses to make both business and personal calls. You reimbursed your employee the $21.80 (including GST) concession and provided that you meet all other input tax claim conditions, you may claim the GST that is proportionate to the amount that you reimbursed your employee i.e. $1.80.\n\nIf you have difficulties determining the business and private portions of the expenses, you may claim input tax as follows:\n\n(i) For full reimbursements, based on 4/72 of the GST incurred on the mobile phone expenses.\n(ii) For partial reimbursements, based on 9/109 of the amount reimbursed or 4/7 of the GST incurred on the mobile phone expenses, whichever is the lower.\n\nAn allowance usually consists of a pre-determined amount to cover an estimated expense and will be paid to your employee regardless of whether he incurs the expense. For example, your employee is given a flat $10 meal allowance if he works beyond his normal working hours and regardless of whether he actually spends the allowance for his meal or how much he spends. Even if your employee provides you with the receipt or invoice for his meal, the GST incurred is not claimable.\n\nTo satisfy the condition of \u201cfor the purpose of business\u201d, the provision of fringe benefits must have a close nexus to your business activities (\u201cClose Nexus Test\u201d). The fact that the business may benefit from the provision of the fringe benefits such as improved staff morale or motivation is not enough to give rise to a close nexus between the fringe benefits and the business.\n\nIRAS will generally regard this Close Nexus Test as satisfied if the provision of the fringe benefit meets any of the following 6 indicators:\n\n1) Is necessary for the proper operation of your business\n2) Directly maintains or promotes the efficiency of your business operations\n3) Primarily promotes staff interaction\n4) Encourages the upgrading of your employee\u2019s skills and knowledge relevant to your business\n5) Is given in recognition of the contribution of your employee towards your business\n6) Promotes corporate identity\n\nFurther explanation of these indicators is provided in paragraphs 6.5 to 6.16. Paragraphs 7.2 to 7.25 explain the Comptroller\u2019s position on some common fringe benefits, in particular, why the fringe benefit can or cannot be considered as incurred for the purpose of business.\n\nGST incurred on goods and services is also not claimable where the goods and services acquired are given only to specific persons (i.e. the fringe benefits are not given to other employees). The Comptroller will generally regard such fringe benefits as incurred for the personal consumption of the specific employee and hence, they will not satisfy the condition of \u201cfor the purpose of business\u201d. Specific persons are:\n\n(i) the sole-proprietor of a GST-registered sole-proprietorship;\n(ii) the partners of a GST-registered partnership;\n(iii) the directors of a GST-registered company; and\n(iv) persons connected to the GST-registered sole proprietor, partnership or company, as the case may be.\n\nHowever, the Comptroller recognises that some businesses only allow specific persons to attend courses. Hence, the Comptroller will allow the input tax incurred on such courses provided that the courses are relevant to the business. An example would be tax courses attended by the partners of a tax consultancy firm.\n\nFor other fringe benefits, the input tax incurred is claimable only if similar fringe benefits are also provided to staff. For example, input tax incurred on refreshments at board of directors\u2019 meeting is claimable if refreshments are also provided at staff meetings.\n\nIf your business makes partly exempt and partly taxable supplies, such expenses are generally considered as residual in nature and you would have to apportion the input tax incurred. For more information, please refer to the e-Tax guide \u201cGST: Partial Exemption and Input Tax Recovery\u201d.\n\nUnder regulations 26 and 27 of the GST (General) Regulations, you are not allowed to claim input tax credit for GST incurred on the following:\n\n(i) Benefits provided to the family members or relatives of your staff;\n(ii) Costs and running expenses incurred on private registered motor cars (including cost incurred for the purchase and running expenses like petrol, maintenance, parking fees) except where the car is excluded from the definition of a 'motor car' in regulation 25(1) of the GST (General) Regulations;\n(iii) Club subscription fees (including transfer fees) charged by sports and recreation clubs;\n(iv) Expenses incurred on company cars of which the COE has been renewed or extended on or after 1 Apr 1998;\n(v) Expenses incurred on rental cars hired for use on or after 1 Jul 1999;\n(vi) Medical expenses incurred for your staff unless \u2013 \n(a) the expenses are obligatory under the Work Injury Compensation Act or under any collective agreement within the meaning of the Industrial Relations Act; or\n(b) the medical treatment in respect of expenses incurred on or after 1 Oct 2021 is provided in connection with any health risk or requirement arising on account of the nature of the work required of your staff or his work environment; and\n(i) the medical expenses are incurred pursuant to any written law of Singapore concerning the medical treatment or the provision of a medical facility or medical practitioner; or\n(ii) the medical treatment is related to COVID-19 and the staff undergoes such medical treatment pursuant to any written advisory (including industry circular) issued by, or posted on the website of, the Government or a public authority of Singapore.\n(vii) Medical and accident insurance premiums incurred for your staff unless the insurance or payment of compensation is obligatory under the Work Injury Compensation Act or under any collective agreement within the meaning of the Industrial Relations Act; and\n(viii) Any transaction involving betting, sweepstakes, lotteries, fruit machines or games of chance.\n\nThe definitions of \u201cclub subscription fee\u201d, \u201cmedical and accident insurance premium\u201d, \u201cmedical expenses\u201d, \u201cfamily benefits\u201d and \u201cmotor car\u201d are stated in regulation 25 of the GST (General) Regulations.\n\nFor input tax that is disallowed under regulations 26 and 27, the GST incurred will be a deductible expense under Income Tax if the expense is allowable under the normal rules of deduction for Income Tax.\n\nYou may be required to account for output tax on fringe benefits provided to your employees if you have claimed input tax for the GST incurred on acquiring the fringe benefits.\n\nFor services provided free to your employees, you are not required to account for output tax as no supply is treated as being made by you. For example, a carpet cleaning company that provides free carpet cleaning service to the homes of its employees need not account for output tax on the cleaning service.\n\nWhere you give your business goods away to your employees as gifts (\u201cGift Rule\u201d), you are required to account for output tax on the goods:\n\n(i) The cost of the gift is more than $200 (exclusive of GST amount); and\n(ii) You had claimed input tax on the purchase or import of the gift.\n\nIn other words, if you choose not to claim input tax credit for the GST incurred on the goods, you do not need to account for output tax when you subsequently give the goods to your employees even if the cost of the goods is more than $200. You also do not need to account for output tax if no GST was incurred on the purchase of the goods (e.g. goods were purchased from a non-GST registered business).\n\nIf you let your employees use your business goods free of charge for their private purposes, you are deemed to be making a supply of services to your employees and will be required to account for output tax if you have claimed input tax credit on the goods. GST suspended on the supply or import of the goods is treated as input tax allowed to you.\n\nIf you choose not to claim input tax credit for the GST incurred on the goods, you do not need to account for output tax when you let your employees use the goods.\n\nBusiness goods for the temporary use of your employees will not be regarded as provided for their private use if there is a close nexus between the provision and your business activities and hence, you need not account for output tax. \n\nA carpet cleaning company allows its employees to use its carpet cleaning equipment free of charge for their homes. For accommodation and household benefits, there is generally no close nexus to the company\u2019s business activities. Therefore, the use of the company\u2019s cleaning equipment is a deemed supply of services and the company is required to account for output tax if credit for input tax has been allowed to it previously. The value of the supply is the full cost to the company for providing the services.\n\nWhen you provide fringe benefits to your employees at a subsidised or discounted price, the value of supply on which output tax is to be accounted for (\u201ctaxable value\u201d) should be the subsidised price or discounted price. \n\nWhen goods (new or used) are given free to your employees:\n\n(i) The value of supply on which output tax is accountable would be the amount that you would pay if you were to purchase identical goods, taking into account the age and condition of the goods which are given free; or\n(ii) If the value of (i) cannot be determined, the value of supply will be the amount that you would pay if you were to purchase similar goods, taking into account the age and condition of the goods which are given free; or\n(iii) If both (i) and (ii) cannot be determined, then the value of supply would be the cost of producing the goods at the time they are given free.\n\nThe value of supply shall be taken to be nil, hence, you need not account for any output tax when you provide the following items free to your employees:\n\n(i) Catering of food or beverages;\n(ii) Accommodation in a hotel, inn, boarding house or similar establishment.\n\nThe value of supply on which output tax is to be accounted for should be the full cost to you in letting your employee use the goods for free. If you let your employee use your business asset for free, to work out the cost in letting your employee use the asset, you are to:\n\n(i) Take the amount that the item reduces in value during the year (yearly depreciation) and add on any other costs incurred in letting the employee use the asset;\n(ii) Work out how much of the year the item is used privately; and\n(iii) Apply that figure to the sum of the yearly depreciation figure and any other costs incurred in letting the employee use the asset.\n\nOutput tax = Private use / Total use \u00d7 [Amount of depreciation + any other cost] \u00d7 9%\n\nCompany ABC purchases a motorcycle to be used for its deliveries for $10,900 and records its depreciation as $1,090 a year for 10 years. Company ABC lets an employee use it on weekends in the 1st year. Company ABC is on a quarterly GST filing cycle. Hence, the output tax that Company ABC has to account for on the private usage of the motorcycle by its employee in its quarterly return is:\n\nOutput tax = 104/365 x $1090/4 x 9% = $6.99\n\nWhen you provide fringe benefits to your employees, the provision of a fringe benefit will be considered as incurred for the purpose of your business if it has a close nexus to your business activities (\u201cthe Close Nexus Test\u201d).\n\nIf you have met the Close Nexus Test and claimed input tax on goods that you let your employees temporarily use for free, you need not account for output tax if the usage has a close nexus to your business activities.\n\nIf you have met the Close Nexus Test and claimed input tax on goods that you give away as gifts, you will still need to account for output tax if the cost of each gift to your employee is more than $200. The Gift Rule applies even for goods that are given away for business purposes.\n\nThe Comptroller will consider that there is a close nexus between the provision of the fringe benefit and your business as long as any of the following indicators are met:\n\nIndicator 1: Necessary for the proper operation of your business\n\nTo determine whether a fringe benefit is necessary to your business operation, you should take into account factors such as the nature of your business, industry practice, commercial requirements and regulatory requirements which may necessitate the provision of the fringe benefit.\n\nAn example is protective clothing which enables your employees to perform their job duties safely. Another example is dormitories provided to house foreign workers in the construction industry, so as to meet regulatory requirements and ensure the quick and efficient allocation of labour.\n\nIndicator 2: Directly maintains or increases the efficiency of business operations\n\nIf the provision of the fringe benefit allows your employees to better utilise their time and effort in carrying out their job duties which in turn contributes to the efficiency of your business operation, it will be considered as having a close nexus to your business activities.\n\nAn example is the provision of meals in the course of a business meeting which allows the meeting to be carried on without the disruption of a lunch break.\n\nIndicator 3: Primarily promotes staff interaction\n\nFringe benefits incurred at corporate events or activities that primarily promote staff interaction which in turn improve the working relationship between employees and encourage future cooperation will be considered as having a close nexus to your business activities.\n\nExamples are goods and services provided to employees at organised company events such as corporate dinner and dance, company outings, team-bonding activities and lunch time talks held for employees.\n\nIndicator 4: Encourages the upgrading of employee\u2019s skills and knowledge relevant to your business\n\nAlthough the upgrading of skills and knowledge confer personal benefits on your employee, if these skills and knowledge are relevant to your business such as they enable your employees to better perform their job duties, progress further or to perform other job functions in your firm, the Comptroller will regard the expenses incurred as having a close nexus to your business activities. You would need to consider the job scope/duties of your employees or their career progression to determine whether there is a close nexus between the expense and your business activities.\n\nExamples are training programmes for employees to improve their skills and knowledge, and the incurring of professional membership fees.\n\nIndicator 5: Given in recognition of employee\u2019s contributions towards the business\n\nGoods or services given to your employees specifically to reward their past contributions have a stronger link to your business operations than those provided merely to motivate the employee.\n\nAwards given for meeting certain targets set by your firm, providing excellent service and taking zero medical leave will be considered as given in recognition of your employee\u2019s contributions. They also include long service awards as these awards are intended to acknowledge your employee\u2019s long-term contribution to your business.\n\nIndicator 6: Promotes corporate identity\n\nA corporate identity is the overall image of your business in the minds of your customers, investors and employees. If your key intention in providing the fringe benefit is to promote the image of your business, there would be a close nexus to your business operations.\n\nAn example is the provision of uniforms to promote the corporate image. Gifts to your employees such as pens and notebooks that are embossed with your business logo also promote your brand and identify your staff as employees of the company.\n\nThe following paragraphs cover the Comptroller\u2019s position on common fringe benefits and examples of situations where the fringe benefits satisfy the Close Nexus Test. For fringe benefits that are not covered in this guide, you should apply the indicators to your situation and determine whether on balance, the fringe benefits have a close nexus to your business activities.\n\nAccommodation and related household expenses\n\nGeneral Rule: Such expenses do not have a close nexus to your business operations. Accommodation is a domestic expense incurred to satisfy your employee's personal needs. Similarly, household expenses like utilities and property maintenance are primarily for your employee\u2019s personal consumption.\n\nExample 1: Company A recruits an employee from a neighbouring country on an expatriate assignment to oversee the development of a new product line in Singapore. As part of his remuneration package, the employee is provided with accommodation at a serviced apartment. Company A incurs GST on the lease of furniture and fittings and accommodation-related services such as housekeeping. These expenses are primarily incurred for the employee\u2019s personal consumption and do not have a close nexus to Company A\u2019s business activities.\n\nExceptions: Where it is necessary to provide accommodation to ensure minimal disruptions to your business operations, the provision of the accommodation can be regarded as having a close nexus to your business activities. You would have to examine factors such as the purpose of the benefit, the nature of your business, regulatory requirements (if any) and the commercial needs of your business to determine whether such expenses have a close nexus to your business activities.\n\nAn example is a construction business that incurred GST on the provision of dormitories to its foreign workers. The Comptroller will consider that the provision of the dormitories is necessary for the proper operation of the business (Indicator 1) since housing employees together would facilitate quick and efficient allocation of labour to meet the demands of its construction business. Employers are also required to provide accommodation with basic facilities to fulfil obligations under the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations. Similarly, dormitory-related expenses incurred by a shipyard business for its foreign workers would also be considered necessary for the proper operation of the business.\n\nAnother example is accommodation provided to the flight crew of an airline company: Company B is an airline company that provides hotel accommodation to its flight crew during layovers. Due to the quick turnaround time required for airlines and mandatory rest periods, accommodation for its flight crew is necessary for the smooth operation of the business (Indicator 1). In addition, the flight crew is generally not able to exercise a choice in selecting their accommodation. In this instance, the provision of the hotel accommodation has a close nexus to its business activities.\n\nFor accommodation expenses that you incur for corporate activities such as hotels and chalets during company retreats, these expenses have a close nexus to your business activities as they primarily promote interaction between your employees (Indicator 3).\n\nAs an administrative concession, the Comptroller will allow you to claim input tax incurred on temporary accommodation (e.g. hotel room, serviced apartment) provided to your foreign employees who:\n\n(i) relocate to Singapore to take up employment in your company;\n(ii) come to Singapore for business activities, such as business meetings, projects and trade events; or\n(iii) are relocating to another country for example, due to posting back to your head office overseas or are returning to their home country as their employment contract with you is terminated. The concession will not apply to temporary accommodation provided to foreign employees who are temporarily displaced in between two leases.\n\nTemporary accommodation refers to the provision of accommodation for a period not exceeding 31 days per occasion. Prior to 1 Feb 2020, if the provision of temporary accommodation exceeds a period of 31 days per occasion, the entire input tax incurred will be disallowed. To further ease the GST burden on businesses, temporary accommodation expenses incurred on or after 1 Feb 2020, where the accommodation provided exceeds 31 days, you may claim the portion of input tax attributable to the first 31 days.\n\nExample 3: Company C relocates two of its foreign employees to Singapore. Company C puts up the employees in two serviced apartments while it looks for permanent housing for them. Employee A stays in the serviced apartment for 20 days while Employee B stays in the serviced apartment for 40 days. Company C incurs charges of $2,500 + $225 GST for Employee A and $5,000 + $450 GST for Employee B. As an administrative concession, Company C is allowed to claim the GST incurred for the first 31 days of the employees\u2019 temporary stay in the serviced apartment. It can claim for:\n\nEmployee A\u2019s stay $225.00\n\nEmployee B\u2019s stay ($450/40 days x 31 days) $348.75\n\nIf your foreign employee relocates to Singapore or comes to Singapore on short business trips with his or her family members, any costs incurred to house the family members, even on a temporary basis, are blocked as family benefits under regulation 26 of the GST (General) Regulations. However, if your foreign employee is entitled under your company\u2019s policy to a specific type of accommodation (e.g. a hotel suite) for his or her individual stay, input tax will be allowed in full even if the accommodation is used to house both the employee and his or her family members so long as no additional cost is incurred to accommodate the latter. For example, if costs are incurred to provide additional beds in the hotel suite for the family members, input tax on such additional costs will be disallowed.\n\nExample 4: Company D successfully recruits a foreign employee to oversee its new manufacturing plant in Singapore. Company D puts up the foreign employee, his spouse and two children at a hotel suite for a week while the condominium rented for them is undergoing final touches of renovation. Company D incurs hotel charges of $5,450 (GST-inclusive), excluding charges of $545 (GST-inclusive) for an extra bed for one of the children. Under the company\u2019s policy, foreign employees employed for managerial positions are entitled to stay in a five-star hotel room suite or equivalent. As an administrative concession, Company D is allowed to claim GST on the hotel charges of $5,000. The GST incurred on the $500 for the extra bed is disallowed as a family benefit under regulation 26.\n\nTo ease business compliance, as an administrative concession, the Comptroller will allow all transport expenses except for the following:\n\n(i) Transport expenses such as the hiring of taxis to transport your employees from their homes to work and vice versa during ordinary work hours. Employees have a personal responsibility to ensure that they arrive at work on time and can choose the most suitable mode of transport to and from their workplace and home; and\n(ii) Motor car expenses that are blocked under regulation 27. For example, if you incurred GST on a private hire car, input tax is not allowable even if the expense is incurred in a situation that falls under the concession.\n\nExample 5: Company E1 is a manufacturing company located at Tuas. Company E2 is a R&D company located at Queenstown. Both incur GST on the provision of shuttle buses to transport employees between designated pick-up/drop-off points and the company. The Comptroller will allow the GST incurred by both companies. There is no need to consider the location of the company.\n\nProfessional membership fees, education and training expenses\n\nGeneral Rule: Professional membership fees, fees for graduate/post graduate courses and training expenses have a close nexus to the business activities if the course, training or qualification is relevant to your employee\u2019s job or career progression in your business as it enables your employee to better perform his or her job duties or to progress further in your business.\n\nExample 6: Employee A works as an accountant at Company F. He is a member of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA) and receives an invoice billed in his name for his annual membership fee. As the membership is relevant to his job, there is a close nexus to Company F\u2019s business activities.\n\nGeneral Rule: Food and Beverages (\u201cF&B\u201d) is primarily to serve your employee\u2019s need for sustenance and is not regarded to have a close nexus to your business activities. Your employee is able to exercise a choice in what and where he or she wishes to eat. Hence, the Comptroller will not regard the provision of F&B as incurred for the purpose of business.\n\nExceptions: Meals provided at business meetings are considered to have a close nexus to your business since the provision of meals ensures that the meetings can continue with minimal disruption for business efficiency. F&B provided at company functions or events are also considered as having a close nexus as they primarily promote staff interaction.\n\nAs an administrative concession, the Comptroller will also allow you to claim input tax incurred on the following:\n\n(i) F&B provided in any staff cafeteria/canteen or at your premises (e.g. company\u2019s pantry and food catered in for employees);\n(ii) F&B provided to your employees when they work beyond the official working hours (\u201covertime meals\u201d), including meals taken outside your premises; and\n(iii) F&B expenses incurred by your employees at the airport when they leave Singapore for business trips and upon their return.\n\nExample 7: Company G places vending machines at its premises to provide F&B to employees at subsidised cost. The vending machine operator bills Company G for the subsidised portion of the F&B. As an administrative concession, the Comptroller will allow Company G to claim the GST billed by the operator.\n\nExample 8: Company H holds an annual staff retreat at a hotel and provides meals for its employees. The meals that it caters for its employees are for the purpose of business as they are provided at a company event that primarily promotes staff interaction.\n\nExample 9: Company I\u2019s employees are reimbursed for their meals if they work overtime and are obliged to have meals nearby. As an administrative concession, the Comptroller will allow the business to claim the input tax incurred on the F&B.\n\nGeneral rule: The Comptroller will not regard such expenses as having a close nexus to your business activities. Instead, clothing, accessories and personal grooming expenses such as spectacles, cosmetics, perfumes, and hair styling services which form part of your employee\u2019s \u2018everyday\u2019 wardrobe are regarded as incurred for the personal consumption of your employees.\n\nExceptions: Uniforms and protective clothing have a close nexus to your business activities. Protective clothing ensures your employee\u2019s safety in performing work duties and hence is considered as necessary for the proper operation of your business. Uniforms project a collective image of your company, promote corporate identity and serve as a branding tool. In addition, your employee generally would not have a choice in the selection of uniforms or protective clothing.\n\nIf you are in the business of selling the products worn by your employees, the clothing, accessories and grooming products would promote corporate identity. For example, for a clothing retailer, available-for-sale apparel given to employees to wear during work-related events or at work promotes the brand image.\n\nIf your business requires your employees to look attractive or project a uniform image when serving customers, the grooming expenses incurred on these employees can be considered necessary for your business. Examples are grooming expenses incurred for air stewards/stewardesses.\n\nGeneral Rule: Medical expenses are primarily incurred for the personal benefit of your employees. Such expenses have no close nexus to your business operations and thus are disallowed under regulation 26 of the GST (General Regulations), with a few exceptions.\n\nSimilarly, maintaining health is a personal responsibility and health and wellness programmes are for the personal benefit of your employees. These programmes will not be regarded as having a close nexus to your business activities.\n\nExceptions: An exception is health or wellness activities organised as corporate events (i.e. the activities are held on a specific day or days and typically with fixed time slots for each activity) that primarily promote staff interaction.\n\nExample 10: Company J arranges with several vendors to provide a variety of free exercise classes for its employees. Employees are able to sign up on an individual basis according to their interests and the exercise classes take place on a regular basis. These lessons are for the personal well-being of its employees and are not regarded as having a close nexus to Company J\u2019s business activities.\n\nExample 11: Every year, Company K sets aside a day where staff can participate in several free health and fitness activities such as aerobic workouts, yoga, abseiling etc. Company K engages several vendors to carry out the activities. Though the activities are also for the personal well-being of its employees, the primary purpose for such one-off/ad-hoc activities which take place during official working hours is to promote staff interaction and thus the expenses have a close nexus to business activities.\n\nEmployees given a flexible benefits budget can choose their desired benefits from a range of goods or services. The provision of such benefits is not regarded as having a close nexus to your business activities as these benefits are incurred for your employee\u2019s personal consumption.\n\nGeneral Rule: For gifts to employees, the Comptroller will generally regard that they do not have a close nexus to your business activities.\n\nExceptions: Awards or prizes given in recognition of your employee\u2019s work efforts and contributions are considered to have close nexus to your business activities. For example, prizes or awards given for innovative suggestions or work solutions, for attaining performance goals, for providing good customer service, for long service, for taking zero/low medical leave and upon retirement.\n\nGifts given during company events such as those given away to employees during dinner and dance, family day and company retreats are also considered as having close nexus to your business as they primarily promote staff interaction.\n\nAs an administrative concession, the Comptroller will also allow you to claim input tax incurred on the following:\n\n(i) Gifts for special occasions, such as:\nGifts for your employee\u2019s birthday, gifts to welcome your employee to your company, gifts given when he or she leaves your company and get-well gifts when your employee is hospitalised.\nGifts for the wedding of the employee, birth of his/her child and gifts given on the bereavement of your employee or the immediate family members of your employee.\n\nTo enjoy the concession, the gifts must be intended for your employee and not his/her family members;\n(ii) Gifts for festive season such as Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Deepavali and Christmas.\n\nIf input tax has been allowed on the gift, you are required to account for output tax if the cost of each gift to your employee is more than $200.\n\nFor an overview of whether you can claim the GST incurred in providing fringe benefits, you may refer to Annex A.\n\nIf you have claimed input tax under Annex A, you may refer to Annex B to determine whether you need to account for output tax. Annex B is also applicable if you have claimed input tax on business assets that you subsequently allow your employee to use for free.\n\nThe table in Annex C shows common fringe benefits and the general position on input tax claims and accounting for output tax. The table has been prepared based on the following assumptions:\n\n(i) The fringe benefits are provided free to your employees;\n(ii) The fringe benefits are not given solely to the sole-proprietor, partners, directors or persons connected to the aforementioned persons; and\n(iii) The supply is contractually made to you (i.e. the tax invoice is addressed to you), your employee is acting as your agent in receiving the supply of goods or services, or the administrative concession in paragraphs 3.4 to 3.6 applies.\n\nFor enquiries on this e-Tax Guide, please contact the Goods and Services Tax Division at www.iras.gov.sg (select \u201cContact Us\u201d).\n\nThe revisions made to the various editions of the e-Tax Guide will apply with effect from 16 May 2016 unless otherwise stated.",
        "summary": "**Summary: GST Treatment of Fringe Benefits**\n\nThis guide outlines the Goods and Services Tax (GST) implications for fringe benefits provided by GST-registered employers to their employees. Fringe benefits are non-wage benefits that can include goods or services, and the guide specifies when employers can claim input tax and account for output tax on these benefits.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Claiming Input Tax:**\n   - Employers can claim input tax on fringe benefits if they are incurred for business purposes and meet specific conditions:\n     - The employer must be GST-registered.\n     - Goods/services must be supplied to the employer.\n     - They must be used for business purposes and for making taxable supplies.\n     - Claims must not be disallowed under GST regulations.\n     - Employers must ensure the goods/services are not part of a Missing Trader Fraud arrangement.\n\n2. **Output Tax Accounting:**\n   - Employers must account for output tax when giving away business goods as gifts if:\n     - The gift's cost exceeds $200 (exclusive of GST).\n     - Input tax was claimed on the purchase of the gift.\n   - No output tax is required for free services provided to employees.\n\n3. **Close Nexus Test:**\n   - Fringe benefits must have a close nexus to business activities to qualify for input tax claims. Indicators include:\n     - Necessary for business operation.\n     - Maintains or promotes efficiency.\n     - Promotes staff interaction.\n     - Upgrades employee skills relevant to the business.\n     - Recognizes employee contributions.\n     - Promotes corporate identity.\n\n4. **Specific Regulations:**\n   - Input tax claims are disallowed for:\n     - Family benefits.\n     - Private motor car expenses.\n     - Club subscription fees.\n     - Certain medical expenses unless under specific conditions.\n   - Medical expenses are generally personal and not claimable, except for specific corporate wellness events.\n\n5. **Fringe Benefits Examples:**\n   - **Accommodation:** Generally not claimable unless necessary for business operations (e.g., dormitories for foreign workers).\n   - **Transport:** Shuttle services for employees are claimable; personal transport expenses are not.\n   - **Training and Membership Fees:** Claimable if relevant to the employee's job.\n   - **Food and Beverages:** Generally not claimable unless provided during business meetings or events.\n   - **Gifts:** Awards for performance are claimable; gifts for personal occasions are not unless specific conditions are met.\n\n6. **Administrative Concessions:**\n   - Certain expenses are allowed for input tax claims under specific circumstances, such as temporary accommodation for foreign employees and meals during overtime.\n\n7. **Output Tax Calculation:**\n   - For goods given as gifts, the output tax is based on the market value or production cost. For free use of business goods, the output tax is calculated based on depreciation and usage.\n\n8. **Documentation:**\n   - Employers must maintain proper documentation, including tax invoices addressed to them or their employees acting as agents.\n\nThis guide serves as a comprehensive reference for employers regarding the GST treatment of fringe benefits, ensuring compliance with regulations while optimizing tax claims. For further inquiries, employers can contact the Goods and Services Tax Division at the IRAS website.",

        "text": "GST: Concession for REITs and Qualifying Registered Business Trusts Listed in Singapore\n\nAim\n\nReal Estate Investment Trusts listed on the Singapore Exchange (S-REITs) and their Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), as well as qualifying Singapore-listed Registered Business Trusts (S-RBTs), are granted a GST concession to claim GST incurred on business expenses. In February 2025, the Minister of Finance announced an extension of the qualifying period for the GST concession to December 31, 2030. All other qualifying conditions remain unchanged. This guide outlines the qualifying criteria for the GST concession granted to S-REITs and qualifying S-RBTs.\n\nBackground\n\nThe GST concession was introduced to promote Singapore as a preferred listing destination, consolidate its status as a regional REITs hub, and encourage growth in Singapore\u2019s registered business trusts market, focusing on certain business sectors. The concession is granted to S-REITs and S-RBTs engaged in qualifying businesses, such as infrastructure business, aircraft leasing, and ship leasing. S-REITs and qualifying S-RBTs can claim GST incurred on business expenses, excluding disallowed expenses under specific regulations, regardless of whether they are GST registrable or not. The concession allows S-REITs and qualifying S-RBTs to treat all supplies made by the multi-tiered structure as if they are taxable or exempt supplies made by the parent S-REIT and qualifying S-RBT for the purpose of computing GST claims, regardless of whether they make taxable supplies.\n\nIn February 2015, the concession was enhanced to include SPVs set up by S-REITs and qualifying S-RBTs solely to raise funds for their business operations. Financing SPVs are established to manage risks associated with raising funds through financial instruments. The 2015 enhancements allow S-REITs and qualifying S-RBTs to claim GST on business expenses incurred to set up financing SPVs and on the business expenses of financing SPVs, excluding disallowed expenses. The enhanced concession applies to GST incurred from April 1, 2015, to December 31, 2030.\n\nQualifying Conditions\n\nThe qualifying conditions for the concession are as follows:\n\n1. The S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT is listed or will be listed on the Singapore Exchange.\n2. The S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT has veto rights over key operational issues of its SPVs holding the underlying assets.\n3. The underlying assets of the S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT make taxable supplies or out-of-scope supplies that would have been taxable if made in Singapore.\n4. All funds raised by a financing SPV must be on-lent to the S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT and used to finance the business activities of the S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT.\n\nMaking GST Claims\n\nSelf-assessment\n\nThe S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT should assess its eligibility for the enhanced concession based on the conditions stated. There is no need to seek approval from the Comptroller.\n\nStatement of claims\n\nThe S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT must file a statement of claims. For the first GST claims, it should include an organizational structure showing the shareholdings or unit holdings in its SPVs and its effective ownership of the underlying assets. Subsequent changes should be updated with claims.\n\nFor GST-registered S-REIT or S-RBT\n\nIf the S-REIT or its SPV is GST-registered, they should make their input tax claims in their GST returns based on normal input tax attribution rules. If there is any GST incurred that remains unclaimable by normal rules and the conditions under the enhanced concession are satisfied, the S-REIT or S-RBT should follow the claiming rules to determine the GST claimable. The claims made under the enhanced concession should be included in GST returns, and a separate statement of claims should be submitted.\n\nFor S-REITs or qualifying S-RBTs liable for GST registration under reverse charge rules\n\nIf the S-REITs or qualifying S-RBTs are not GST-registered but procure services from overseas suppliers, they would be liable for GST registration under reverse charge rules if the value of their imported services exceeds S$1 million in a 12-month period. Once registered, they will need to report and account for output tax on the imported services in their GST returns.\n\nGST incurred by S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT or its SPVs prior to listing in Singapore\n\nThe S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT should only file its GST claims after it has been listed on the Singapore Exchange. However, it may make retrospective claims of GST on expenses incurred before listing.\n\nAttribution and Apportionment of input tax claims\n\nWhile S-REITs or qualifying S-RBTs can claim GST under the concession, they must still apply partial exemption rules. Input tax that is not claimable under these rules does not become claimable through the concession. However, deviations from normal input tax attribution rules allow certain GST claims. For certain expenses, S-REITs and qualifying S-RBTs can \"look through\" to the supplies made or to be made by the SPVs to determine whether GST incurred on expenses is for making taxable or exempt supplies.\n\nWhen the S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT and its SPVs incur input tax on expenses, the following rules apply:\n\na) Input tax incurred to make taxable supplies or out-of-scope (taxable) supplies will be allowed in full.\nb) Input tax directly attributable to making Regulation 33 exempt supplies will be claimable in full if Regulation 35 is satisfied.\nc) Input tax directly attributable to making non-Regulation 33 exempt supplies or out-of-scope (non-Regulation 33 exempt) supplies will be disallowed.\nd) Residual input tax incurred will be apportioned using the multi-tiered residual input tax apportionment formula.\n\nAs part of business arrangements, S-REITs or qualifying S-RBTs may incur GST on expenses for setting up SPVs and acquiring/divesting SPVs and assets. Details on input tax claiming rules for different types of expenses are provided.\n\nApplying Regulation 33\n\nFor applying Regulation 33, only supplies made by the S-REIT or qualifying S-RBTs should be considered. If the S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT incurs input tax to hedge a loan obtained to acquire shares in an SPV, the input tax incurred is related to a share acquisition of the S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT. The 'look-through' concept does not apply for Regulation 33.\n\nIf the S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT and its SPVs make exempt supplies that fall outside the scope of Regulation 33, it must apportion its claims and claim only the portion of GST attributable to making taxable supplies and out-of-scope (taxable) supplies made within the multi-tiered structure.\n\nInput Tax Apportionment Formula\n\nA S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT that is also an RC Business should not include the value of imported services and low-value goods as taxable supplies for computing the residual input tax claimable.\n\nLonger period adjustments\n\nLike any partially exempt business, the GST allowable to the S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT in a quarter is allowed provisionally, subject to adjustments over the longer period. The S-REIT or qualifying S-RBT must make a second determination on the GST claims at the end of the longer period to determine the GST allowable.\n\nContact Information\n\nFor inquiries on this e-Tax Guide, please contact the Goods and Services Tax Division at the IRAS website.\n\nUpdates and amendments\n\nThe document includes a history of amendments made to the guide, detailing changes and updates over the years.\n\nAppendix 1 \u2013 Definition of infrastructure business\n\nA business trust is treated as being in the infrastructure business if its activities fall within specific categories, including electricity generation, gas distribution, waste management, and more.\n\nAppendix 2 \u2013 Statement of Claims for GST Refund on Purchases made for the Period\n\nThis section includes a template for S-REITs or S-RBTs to fill out when making claims, detailing the necessary information and conditions to be met.\n\nAppendix 3 \u2013 Partial exemption rules\n\nThis section outlines the application of Regulations 28 and 35 for determining GST claims.\n\nAppendix 4 \u2013 Input tax attribution rules for the purpose of GST concession\n\nThis section provides rules for claiming input tax based on the nature of expenses incurred.\n\nAppendix 5 \u2013 Examples\n\nThis section provides illustrative examples of how GST claims should be computed under various scenarios.",
        "summary": "**Summary: GST Concession for REITs and Qualifying Registered Business Trusts Listed in Singapore**\n\n**Objective**: The article discusses the GST concession available to Real Estate Investment Trusts (S-REITs) and qualifying Registered Business Trusts (S-RBTs) listed on the Singapore Exchange, allowing them to claim GST on business expenses. The concession has been extended to December 31, 2030.\n\n**Background**: The GST concession aims to enhance Singapore's attractiveness as a listing destination for REITs and business trusts, particularly in sectors like infrastructure, aircraft leasing, and ship leasing. It allows S-REITs and S-RBTs to claim GST on business expenses, irrespective of their GST registration status, while treating supplies made by their Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) as taxable or exempt for GST purposes.\n\n**Qualifying Conditions**:\n1. The S-REIT or S-RBT must be listed or set to be listed on the Singapore Exchange.\n2. It must have veto rights over key operational issues of its SPVs.\n3. The underlying assets must generate taxable or out-of-scope supplies that would be taxable if made in Singapore.\n4. Funds raised by financing SPVs must be on-lent to the S-REIT or S-RBT for business activities.\n\n**GST Claims Process**:\n- **Self-assessment**: S-REITs and S-RBTs assess their eligibility without needing Comptroller approval.\n- **Statement of claims**: A statement must be filed detailing ownership structures and claims.\n- **For GST-registered entities**: Claims are made in GST returns based on standard attribution rules. Unclaimable GST can be claimed under the concession if conditions are met.\n- **Reverse charge rules**: Non-GST registered entities procuring overseas services exceeding S$1 million must register for GST and report output tax.\n\n**Pre-listing GST Claims**: Claims for GST incurred before listing can be made retrospectively after the entity is listed.\n\n**Input Tax Claims**:\n- Full claims for input tax on taxable or out-of-scope supplies.\n- Claims for exempt supplies depend on specific regulations.\n- Residual input tax must be apportioned using a multi-tiered formula.\n\n**Longer Period Adjustments**: Claims are provisional and subject to adjustments at the end of a longer period.\n\n**Contact Information**: For inquiries, contact the Goods and Services Tax Division via the IRAS website.\n\n**Appendices**: The article includes definitions of infrastructure businesses, a claims statement template, partial exemption rules, input tax attribution rules, and illustrative examples for clarity on GST claims.\n\nThis summary encapsulates the key aspects of the GST concession for S-REITs and S-RBTs, focusing on eligibility, claims process, and regulatory requirements.",

        "text": "Multinational Enterprise Top-up Tax and Domestic Top-up Tax\n\nThis e-Tax guide sets out the key parameters of the MTT and DTT which are provided in the MMT Act and subsidiary legislations. Further guidance on MTT and DTT, such as on the transition rules and safe harbours, will be released progressively.\n\nThis e-Tax guide is relevant to MNE groups with annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more in the CFS of the UPE in at least two of the four preceding FYs, in line with the Pillar Two GloBE rules.\n\nAs announced in the 2024 Budget Statement, Singapore will implement a DTT and the IIR under Pillar Two of the BEPS 2.0 initiative, which will impose a minimum ETR of 15% on businesses\u2019 profits from FYs starting on or after 1 January 2025. The MMT Act has been enacted to implement the IIR (which is referred to as the MTT in the Act) and DTT. The MTT and DTT are based on the published GloBE Model Rules, Commentary and AGs.\n\nMTT and DTT apply to MNE groups with annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more in the CFS of the UPE in at least two out of the four preceding FYs (also known as in-scope MNE groups).\n\nThe UPE of an in-scope MNE group must notify the Comptroller of Income Tax (the \u201cComptroller\u201d) of its liability to be registered under the MMT Act. The Comptroller may register an in-scope MNE group that fails to register.\n\nAll registered MNE groups liable for MTT and/or DTT are required to file tax returns on their top-up tax liability in Singapore. All registered MNE groups are also required to file a GIR with Singapore, unless the GIR is filed with another jurisdiction and in such a case, a GloBE notification (if Singapore will receive the GIR through a filing made in another jurisdiction via exchange of information) must be filed with Singapore.\n\nIn October 2021, the IF agreed on a two-pillar solution (commonly known as BEPS 2.0) to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. As part of Pillar Two under BEPS 2.0, the GloBE Model Rules and its Commentary were released on 20 December 2021 and 14 March 2022, respectively. These, together with AGs issued subsequently, are known as the \u201cGloBE rules\u201d.\n\nThe GloBE rules comprise the IIR and the UTPR. Broadly, the GloBE rules are designed to ensure that in-scope MNE groups pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction where they operate. A top-up tax on excess profits arising in a jurisdiction will be imposed whenever the ETR of the MNE group, determined on a jurisdictional basis, is below the minimum rate of 15%.\n\nThe GloBE rules recognise that jurisdictions may introduce domestic minimum top-up taxes to bring the ETR of LTCEs operating in those jurisdictions to 15%. Where such taxes are regarded as QDMTTs under the GloBE rules, they will reduce the top-up tax that would otherwise arise under IIR or UTPR in respect of such LTCEs.\n\nSingapore will implement MTT and DTT for businesses\u2019 FYs starting on or after 1 January 2025. The MTT and DTT are based on the published GloBE Model Rules, Commentary and AGs. A summary table of provisions in the MMT Act, and (if applicable) the corresponding provisions in the published GloBE Model Rules, Commentary and AGs, is at Annex B.\n\nMTT and DTT will apply to an MNE group for a FY beginning on or after 1 January 2025. For this purpose, the FY is generally determined based on the accounting period of the UPE\u2019s CFS.\n\nThis means that if the CFS of the UPE of an MNE group are prepared for an accounting period from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025, MTT and DTT will apply to in-scope entities of that MNE group whose financial results are consolidated into that CFS for the same period i.e. 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. This applies even if the FYs of some of the in-scope entities do not begin from 1 January 2025 (e.g. the entities\u2019 FY could be from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025 for their individual financial accounts, but they will nonetheless be considered as in-scope entities from 1 January 2025).\n\nMTT and DTT apply to an MNE group that has annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more in the CFS of the UPE in at least two of the four FYs immediately preceding the tested FY (the \u201crevenue threshold\u201d). The following table illustrates how the revenue threshold is to be applied:\n\nWhen determining whether an MNE group meets the revenue threshold, the annual revenue threshold of EUR 750 million is adjusted proportionally to correspond with the period covered by the relevant FY. For example, if a FY of an MNE group consists of only 9 months, then the applicable annual revenue threshold for that particular FY will be EUR 562.5 million (750 million x 9/12).\n\nNotwithstanding Section 5, certain entities are not subject to the MTT and DTT (i.e. excluded entities). MTT and DTT adopt the same scope of excluded entities as the GloBE rules. This means that:\n\na. Attributes of excluded entities such as their profits, losses, taxes accrued, tangible assets, and payroll expenses are excluded from the various computations under MTT and DTT including the de minimis exclusion.\n\nb. However, the revenue of excluded entities would still be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the revenue threshold of the MNE group in paragraph 5.1 is met.\n\nc. Excluded entities do not have any administrative obligations under MTT and DTT, such as the filing of a GIR.\n\nExamples of excluded entities include a governmental entity, an international organisation and a non-profit organisation. Please refer to Article 1.5 of the GloBE Model Rules and its accompanying Commentary for further information.\n\nBesides excluded entities, the MTT and DTT regimes also provide for the following three types of exclusions in accordance with the GloBE rules as stated below. These three types of exclusions affect the computation of the top-up amount under the GloBE rules. They do not affect the determination of whether the revenue threshold of the MNE group is met and the administrative obligations for the MNE group under the MTT and DTT regimes:\n\na. International Shipping Income Exclusion: A CE\u2019s international shipping income or qualified ancillary international shipping income is excluded from the computation of its GloBE income or loss if the strategic or commercial management of all ships concerned is effectively carried on within the jurisdiction where the CE is located.\n\nb. SBIE: The SBIE provides for a formulaic, substance-based carve-out, based on a percentage of the eligible payroll costs and carrying value of eligible tangible assets of the MNE group. The SBIE seeks to exclude a fixed return for substantive activities within a jurisdiction from the application of the GloBE rules.\n\nc. De Minimis Exclusion: MNE groups may make an annual election for the de minimis exclusion. To qualify for a de minimis exclusion for a jurisdiction for a FY, (a) the average GloBE revenue of CEs (not being stateless entities, investment entities or insurance investment entities) in the jurisdiction for that FY and the two preceding FYs must be less than EUR 10 million and (b) the average GloBE income of those CEs for the same period must be less than EUR 1 million or the CEs must be in a loss position. If so, the top-up amounts for that FY of those CEs are deemed to be nil.\n\nThe MTT and DTT regimes also provide for safe harbours that help reduce the MNE groups\u2019 compliance burden (e.g. avoiding the need for detailed MTT or DTT calculations). Where a safe harbour is elected by an MNE group for a jurisdiction, the top-up amounts for qualifying entities of the MNE group in the jurisdiction are treated as nil. Currently, the GloBE rules provide for four safe harbours:\n\nSafe harbours (a) to (c) mentioned above will treat the top-up amounts under MTT, DTT or both (as the case may be) as nil, where applicable.\n\nMTT applies to a Singapore parent entity\u2019s ownership interest in its relevant entities outside Singapore and its stateless entities but does not apply to its ownership interest in its domestic entities. The minimum rate for MTT is 15% and the top-up amount is computed using the ETR that is calculated on a jurisdictional basis for an MNE group.\n\nAn entity is a chargeable entity for MTT if it is a responsible member located in Singapore of an MNE group and holds an ownership interest in a CE located outside Singapore or a stateless entity of the MNE group that has a top-up amount for the FY (called a relevant entity).\n\nA responsible member of an MNE group is any of the following entities located in Singapore or subject to a qualified IIR in the jurisdiction where it is located:\n\na. the UPE of the MNE group;\n\nb. an intermediate parent entity of the MNE group if no other member of the MNE group that owns a controlling interest in the entity is a responsible member (e.g. the UPE);\n\nc. a partially-owned parent entity of the MNE group if it is not wholly-owned by another partially-owned parent entity of the MNE group that is a responsible member.\n\nThe amount of MTT chargeable on a chargeable entity for a FY is the sum of the top-up tax of each relevant entity of the chargeable entity for the FY.\n\nWhere the chargeable entity holds its indirect ownership interest in a relevant entity X through another responsible member of the MNE group, the amount of MTT payable by the chargeable entity is reduced by the proportionate amount of MTT or any qualified IIR payable by that responsible member in respect of the relevant entity X. This situation may arise, for example, when the chargeable entity is a UPE and holds an ownership interest in another responsible member that is a partially-owned parent entity; hence both the chargeable entity and that responsible member would pay respectively MTT or qualified IIR in respect of the same relevant entity.\n\nFor a relevant entity (that is not an investment entity or an insurance investment entity) of a chargeable entity, the top-up tax for a FY is computed as follows:\n\nTop-up tax = (Top-up amount of the relevant entity for the FY) x (Chargeable entity\u2019s inclusion ratio for the relevant entity for the FY)\n\nThe chargeable entity\u2019s inclusion ratio for a relevant entity for a FY is the proportion of the GloBE income of the relevant entity for the FY that is not attributable to entities other than the chargeable entity.\n\nIn accordance with the GloBE rules, separate computations of top-up amount are required for each category of entities, or each special entity as the case may be.\n\nThe top-up amount of a CE that is not a special entity is determined as follows:\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1: For each CE in the MNE group,\na. Determine GloBE income or loss\nb. Determine adjusted covered taxes\n\nStep 2: For each jurisdiction,\na. Aggregate the GloBE income or loss of all CEs (that are not special entities) located in that jurisdiction\nb. Aggregate the adjusted covered taxes of all those CEs\nc. Determine ETR for that jurisdiction by dividing (b) by (a)\n\nStep 3: For each of those jurisdictions with ETR below 15% or have an additional current top-up amount,\na. Determine the jurisdictional top-up amount\nb. Determine the top-up amount of each CE (that is not a special entity) by apportioning the jurisdictional top-up amount\n\nThe jurisdictional top-up amount for the MNE group for a jurisdiction for a FY is determined as follows:\n\n(Top-up tax percentage x Excess profits) + Additional current top-up amount - Qualified domestic minimum top-up tax\n\nThe top-up tax percentage for the MNE group for a jurisdiction for a FY is the difference between the minimum rate of 15% and the ETR for the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the FY (if the ETR is less than 15%). The top-up tax percentage is nil if the ETR for the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the FY is 15% or more.\n\nThe excess profits for the MNE group for a jurisdiction for a FY is the sum of the GloBE income or loss for the FY of the CEs (not being special entities) of the MNE group located in the jurisdiction less the SBIE for the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the FY. The excess profits for the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the FY cannot be less than nil.\n\nThe jurisdictional top-up amount for the MNE group for a jurisdiction for the FY is apportioned between the CEs (not being special entities) of the MNE group that are located in that jurisdiction. The apportionment is generally based on the GloBE income of the CEs for the FY.\n\nThe top-up amount of an entity that is a special entity is determined as follows:\n\nType of special entity Treatment\n\nStateless entity\nTop-up amount is determined in a similar manner as paragraph 7.3.7 above and modified accordingly for these respective special entities so that separate ETRs will apply to these special entities.\n\nMinority-owned CE and member of a minority-owned subgroup\nTop-up amount is determined in a similar manner as paragraph 7.3.7 above except as specified below. The ETR of an investment entity or insurance investment entity is calculated separately from any other CEs in the same jurisdiction. If the MNE group owns interests in investment entities or multiple insurance entities located in the same jurisdiction, a single ETR is computed for all such entities in the jurisdiction.\n\nInvestment entity and insurance investment entity\nGloBE income or loss and adjusted covered taxes are reduced to only the amount attributable to the UPE\u2019s share in the investment entity or insurance investment entity.\n\nThe calculations for MTT are to be carried out in the presentation currency of the UPE\u2019s CFS.\n\nThe currency used for thresholds in the MMT Act are based on Euros. For the purpose of determining whether relevant threshold amounts in the MMT Act are met, an MNE group whose UPE\u2019s CFS presentation currency is not in Euros must translate the relevant amounts in its financial statements to Euros. Such translation is to be based on the average foreign exchange rate for the December month of the calendar year immediately before the relevant FY.\n\nDTT is a tax imposed in Singapore on MNE groups that meet the revenue threshold in paragraph 5.1, in addition to CIT.\n\nDTT applies to in-scope entities of an MNE group. It does not apply to a wholly domestic group.\n\nIn-scope entities for DTT refer to the following categories of entities of or connected to an MNE group:\n\na. the members (including partially owned CEs) of the MNE group located in Singapore;\n\nb. joint ventures and JV subsidiaries located in Singapore;\n\nc. members of a minority-owned subgroup, and minority-owned CEs located in Singapore; and\n\nd. reverse hybrid entities which are formed, registered or incorporated in Singapore; and are not responsible members.\n\nDTT does not apply to CEs that are located outside Singapore, excluded entities, stateless permanent establishments and tax transparent entities of MNE groups. MTT, qualified IIR or qualified UTPR may apply to these entities instead. For investment entities and insurance investment entities that are located in Singapore, the top-up amount of these entities is treated as nil for DTT purpose.\n\nDTT is applicable to in-scope entities of the MNE group located in Singapore that are excluded from the UTPR under Article 9.3 of GloBE Model Rules.\n\nDTT is designed to meet the conditions of a QDMTT such that the DTT liability will be offset against any IIR/UTPR liabilities in respect of low-taxed profits of in-scope entities located in Singapore that may arise from the application of the GloBE rules in other jurisdictions.\n\nDTT is also designed to satisfy the requirements of the QDMTT Safe Harbour. Where the QDMTT Safe Harbour applies under the GloBE rules in other jurisdictions, the application of the GloBE rules in these jurisdictions is turned off by treating any top-up tax payable under the GloBE rules to be nil. In this way, MNE groups only undertake one computation for QDMTT (i.e. DTT in Singapore) without the need to make a further calculation under the GloBE rules in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe DTT ensures that in-scope entities of an MNE group located in Singapore will be charged a top-up amount (that is, the DTT) if their jurisdictional ETR is below 15%. This will raise the ETR of the MNE group to 15% in Singapore. DTT is calculated in a similar way to MTT with the exceptions highlighted in paragraphs 8.7.1 and 9.1.\n\nA CE in Singapore, known as a DFE, will be chargeable with DTT of an MNE group, unless the MNE group makes an election to allocate a specified amount of the DTT to a qualifying CE. A qualifying CE does not include a CE with GloBE loss; a CE which is a flow-through entity that is not a reverse hybrid entity; a CE with ETR of 15% or more; and a CE which is no longer in the MNE group.\n\nIf the DFE does not pay DTT on-time resulting in DTT in arrears, every CE located in Singapore of an MNE group, joint venture and JV subsidiary located in Singapore which are connected with the MNE group, and reverse hybrid entity of the MNE group will be jointly and severally liable for the DTT or interest in arrears for the FY that the DTT relates to.\n\nThe top-up amount of the MNE group is the sum of the following:\n\na. the top-up amount of the CEs (other than special entities) located in Singapore;\n\nb. the top-up amount of any joint venture and JV subsidiary located in Singapore;\n\nc. the top-up amount of the members of a minority-owned subgroup and minority-owned CEs located in Singapore; and\n\nd. the top-up amount of each reverse hybrid entity (not being a responsible member) formed, registered or incorporated in Singapore.\n\nSimilar to MTT, separate computation of top-up amount for each category of entities, or each special entity is required.\n\nThe tax payable under DTT is the whole jurisdictional top-up amount, regardless of the level of ownership interest of the parent entity in the in-scope entities.\n\nThe jurisdictional top-up amount is computed based on the following formula:\n\n(Top-up tax percentage x Excess profits) + Additional current top-up amount\n\nThe top-up tax percentage is the difference between the 15% minimum rate and the ETR of the MNE group in Singapore, while the excess profits is the difference between the sum of the GloBE income or loss of the entities located in Singapore less the SBIE for those entities.\n\nThe computation of DTT is in accordance with the GloBE rules and the conditions for QDMTT and QDMTT Safe Harbour. In particular, for the purpose of computing ETR in Singapore, DTT does not take into account the allocation of cross-border taxes such as CFC taxes incurred by a parent entity or taxes incurred by a foreign main entity with respect to profits attributable to its permanent establishment in Singapore.\n\nThe DTT computations are based on the financial statements prepared in accordance with the LFAS rule subject to the conditions therein.\n\nThe local financial accounting standards refer to:\n\n\u2022 Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I));\n\u2022 Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS); or\n\u2022 Singapore Financial Reporting Standards for Small Entities (SFRS for SE)\n\nDTT computation will be determined based on LFAS if all the CEs of the MNE group located in Singapore have financial statements prepared in accordance with the accounting standards made or formulated under Part 3 of Singapore\u2019s Accounting Standards Act 2007 and the CEs are required to keep or use such accounts under any written law in Singapore; or such financial statements are audited by an external financial auditor.\n\nWhere not all CEs located in Singapore meet the above requirements or the FY of their financial statements is different from the FY of the CFS of the UPE, the DTT computations shall be computed based on the financial accounting standard used in the preparation of the CFS of the UPE.\n\nThe table below summarises the key differences between MTT and DTT.\n\nMTT is a tax imposed on the low-taxed income of CEs, joint ventures and JV subsidiaries located outside Singapore and stateless CEs. DTT is imposed on the low-taxed income of CEs, joint ventures and JV subsidiaries located in Singapore, and reverse hybrid entities formed, registered or incorporated in Singapore which are not responsible members.\n\nThe parent entity that is a responsible member located in Singapore is responsible for the payment of MTT, while the DFE is responsible for the payment of DTT.\n\nThe filing process for MTT and DTT will be treated as complete without a need for IRAS to assess the tax and issue a notice of assessment. IRAS may select MTT and DTT returns filed by taxpayers for audit as part of IRAS\u2019 regular compliance reviews. If IRAS is of the view that the MTT or DTT declared is inaccurate, IRAS may issue a notice of assessment to revise the tax payable. If the MNE group disagrees with IRAS\u2019 assessment, it can object to the assessment within two months of the service of the notice of assessment.\n\nThe UPE of an MNE group that has a CE or a JV located in Singapore or a reverse hybrid entity formed, registered or incorporated in Singapore (not being a responsible member) must notify the Comptroller of the MNE group\u2019s liability to be registered under the MMT Act. The registration is a one-time process, and the registration form will be available digitally. The registration must be made within six months after the first FYE of the UPE where MTT or DTT, or both, applies to the MNE group.\n\nThe MNE group will be required to designate a single Singapore CE to be the DFE and GFE to fulfil tax obligations in Singapore. The same CE will be designated as the DFE and GFE. The rules in determining the DFE and GFE of an MNE group are set out below:\n\nWhere the UPE is a legal entity located in Singapore, and is not an excluded entity, the UPE is the DFE/GFE. Otherwise, an intermediate parent entity that is a legal entity located in Singapore, is the parent entity of all other Singapore CEs and is not an excluded entity, is the DFE/GFE. If there is no such UPE/IPE, any CE in Singapore can be designated as the DFE/GFE if the designated CE is a legal entity located in Singapore, or if no such legal entity exists, a permanent establishment located in Singapore (including a branch of a foreign company registered in Singapore).\n\nThe appointment of the DFE/GFE must be made within six months after the first FYE of the UPE where MTT or DTT, or both, applies to the MNE group. The first appointment of the DFE/GFE is made together with the registration of the MNE group.\n\nIf the DFE/GFE no longer exists or no longer belongs to the group, the UPE must inform the Comptroller of the new DFE/GFE no later than a month after the DFE/GFE ceases to be a part of the group or such extended time as the Comptroller may allow.\n\nThe MNE group will be required to designate another Singapore CE as the new DFE/GFE. The newly appointed DFE/GFE will be required to carry out any duty of the previous DFE/GFE that has yet to be fulfilled as at the date of new appointment.\n\nThe table below sets out the key timelines for MTT and DTT, and the entity responsible for fulfilling the respective obligations:\n\nAll registered MNE groups liable for MTT and/or DTT are required to file tax returns on their top-up tax liability in Singapore. The filing of tax returns for MTT and DTT will be available in digital service.\n\nThe GIR is a standardised information return required under the GloBE rules. By default, every Singapore CE of an MNE group will have an obligation to file a GIR with IRAS, regardless of where the MNE group is headquartered. The GFE of a registered MNE group in Singapore is required to file the GIR annually with IRAS on behalf of its represented entities in Singapore. The format and requirements of the GIR will be based on the document titled \u201cTax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy \u2013 GloBE Information Return\u201d issued by the IF on 17 July 2023.\n\nA foreign CE, such as the UPE of a foreign MNE group, may file a GIR centrally in a foreign jurisdiction. Where a GIR has been filed in another jurisdiction outside Singapore and Singapore has an information exchange agreement with that foreign jurisdiction to receive the GIR, the GFE in Singapore will not be required to file a GIR with IRAS. However, the GFE will still be required to file a GloBE notification annually with IRAS. The notification will inform IRAS of the identity of the filing CE (e.g. the foreign UPE) and where the GIR is filed. This is to facilitate the transmission of the GIR to IRAS via automatic exchange of information.\n\nThe parent entity that is a responsible member located in Singapore, the DFE and the GFE are responsible for submitting the MTT return, DTT return and GIR/GloBE notification respectively.\n\nThe due date for submission of the MTT and DTT returns and the GIR/GloBE notification will be 15 months after the end of each FY (or 18 months if the FY is a transition year). If the MTT or DTT returns are not submitted by the filing due date, IRAS may estimate the MTT or DTT payable and issue a notice of assessment.\n\nIf an MNE group chooses to file its GIR centrally in an implementing jurisdiction according to Article 8.1.2 of the GloBE Model Rules, the information in the GIR will be disseminated to other implementing jurisdictions where the MNE group is operating in based on an approach that has been agreed by the IF. The IF has adopted the following targeted dissemination approach for sharing the GIR of each MNE group.\n\nThe record-keeping periods for MTT and DTT are as follows:\n\nThe records to be kept for MTT and DTT purposes are generally aligned with the records to be kept for CIT or accounting purposes. Examples of records are general ledgers, invoices, accounting records and schedules, bank statements and pre-consolidated accounts.\n\nAn extended record-keeping period is applicable to supporting documents substantiating the calculation of the provisions in the GloBE rules that require looking back at the MNE group\u2019s past years\u2019 figures. In such cases, the supporting documents are to be kept for up to ten years (i.e. beyond the general record keeping period of five years). The extended record keeping period is required for IRAS to verify the accuracy of the computations done by the MNE group.\n\nThe statutory time limits to raise an assessment for MTT and DTT are as follows:\n\nThe parent entity that is a responsible member located in Singapore and the DFE are responsible for the payment of MTT and DTT respectively.\n\nFor DTT purpose, the DFE can elect under section 45 of the MMT Act to have a qualifying entity in the group (X) to be allocated a share of the MNE group\u2019s DTT liability. Please refer to paragraph 8.5.1 for the CEs which do not qualify for the election. An MNE group can elect up to 30 CEs for any FY.\n\nIf the election is made, X will be responsible for payment of the allocated amount to IRAS and the DFE will be liable to pay the remaining MNE group\u2019s DTT. The election can be made on a yearly basis at the point of filing the DTT return and is irrevocable for that FY.\n\nThe due date for payment of MTT and DTT is no later than one month after the filing due date of the MTT and DTT return respectively. Where the Comptroller issues a notice of assessment, the due date for payment of the MTT or DTT is within one month after the service of the notice.\n\nWhere MTT or DTT has been computed in a currency other than Singapore dollars, the tax payable in foreign currency needs to be converted into Singapore dollars for payment to IRAS. The exchange rate to be used is the average exchange rate, as made available by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, calculated on the basis of the rate of exchange at the end of each month for that FY.\n\nThe time periods for the repayment of MTT and DTT and the claiming of relief for error or mistake in respect of an MTT and DTT return, are aligned with the statutory time limits for MTT and DTT assessments respectively.\n\nA claim for repayment, or an application for relief, must be made no later than:\n\nThe UPE of a registered MNE group must inform the Comptroller of the following events:\n\nPenalties (including composition amounts or fines) and/or surcharges may be imposed under the MMT Act where an in-scope MNE group fails to meet its obligations for MTT and DTT. Some of the key obligations have been highlighted in paragraph 10.10.\n\nMTT and DTT are taxes charged on the income of an MNE group. They are not incurred in the production of income. Thus, they are not deductible for CIT purposes in Singapore, under section 15(1)(g) of the ITA.\n\nAny qualified IIR, qualified UTPR and QDMTT or taxes substantially similar to these taxes are not allowed for tax deduction for CIT purposes in Singapore.\n\nQualified IIR, qualified UTPR and QDMTT refer to taxes imposed by the law of another jurisdiction that are prescribed by the Minister in the regulations as being equivalent in effect as the MTT, tax imposed by the UTPR in the GloBE rules, and DTT respectively.\n\nIn terms of rule order, qualified IIR and qualified UTPR (or substantially similar taxes) imposed by other jurisdictions (\u201cforeign GloBE taxes\u201d) are to be imposed after the application of CIT in Singapore. Allowing a deduction for foreign GloBE taxes for CIT purposes would thus create circularity in the charging of CIT under the ITA. Tax deduction is therefore not allowed on such amounts.\n\nA QDMTT is a form of tax on income, as the tax base in the computation of QDMTT is premised on the entity\u2019s accounting profits (i.e. income). Hence, similar to DTT, QDMTT (or substantially similar taxes) imposed by other jurisdictions, are disallowed for tax deduction for CIT purposes in Singapore.\n\nFor CIT purposes in Singapore, FTC may be allowed on foreign DMTT paid or payable on:\n\nFor the Singapore CE to qualify for FTC claims in Singapore on foreign DMTT paid or payable, the following conditions must be met:\n\nFor dividend income derived by the Singapore CE, the FTC will take into account the underlying tax paid by the dividend-paying company in the foreign jurisdiction.\n\nFor the purpose of granting the FTC, the portion of foreign DMTT in respect of which FTC may be allowed must be clearly attributed to the remitted (or deemed remitted) income. If there is no clear attribution of the taxes to the remitted (or deemed remitted) income, no FTC will be allowed.\n\nFTC will not be allowed for foreign GloBE taxes for CIT purposes in Singapore. In terms of rule order, foreign GloBE taxes are to be imposed after the application of income tax. Providing FTC in Singapore for foreign GloBE taxes creates circularity, since the foreign GloBE taxes are determined after taking into account the income tax payable (net of FTC) of the Singapore CE. In addition, the foreign GloBE taxes are payable by a parent entity and not by the entity who derives the income.\n\nUnder the FSIE scheme, foreign-sourced dividends, foreign branch profits and foreign sourced service income received by resident taxpayers in Singapore are exempt from tax if all the following conditions are met:\n\nUnder the FTC pooling system, resident taxpayers in Singapore may elect for FTC pooling if all the following conditions are met:\n\nWhen determining whether the \u201csubject to tax\u201d condition is met under FSIE and FTC pooling system:\n\nIf the highest corporate tax rate of a foreign jurisdiction of source in the year the foreign income is remitted (or deemed remitted to Singapore) from that foreign jurisdiction is at least 15%, the \u201cforeign headline tax rate of at least 15%\u201d condition for FSIE and FTC pooling system is considered to be met.\n\nAny request for clarification on the e-Tax guide can be sent to IRAS_Pillar_Two@iras.gov.sg.",
        "summary": "**Summary of Multinational Enterprise Top-up Tax (MTT) and Domestic Top-up Tax (DTT)**\n\n**Overview:**\nThe MTT and DTT are taxes introduced in Singapore as part of the implementation of the OECD's BEPS 2.0 initiative, specifically under Pillar Two, which aims to ensure that multinational enterprises (MNEs) pay a minimum effective tax rate (ETR) of 15% on their profits. These taxes will apply to MNE groups with annual revenues of EUR 750 million or more starting from financial years (FYs) beginning on or after January 1, 2025.\n\n**Key Features:**\n1. **Eligibility:** \n   - MTT and DTT apply to MNE groups with annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more in the consolidated financial statements (CFS) of the ultimate parent entity (UPE) for at least two of the four preceding FYs.\n   - Excluded entities (e.g., governmental entities, international organizations, non-profits) are not subject to MTT and DTT but their revenues count towards the revenue threshold.\n\n2. **Tax Registration and Filing:**\n   - The UPE must notify the Comptroller of Income Tax of its liability to register under the MMT Act.\n   - Registered MNE groups must file tax returns for their top-up tax liabilities and may also need to file a GloBE Information Return (GIR).\n\n3. **Tax Calculation:**\n   - MTT applies to low-taxed income from entities outside Singapore, while DTT applies to low-taxed income from entities within Singapore.\n   - The top-up tax is calculated based on the difference between the minimum ETR (15%) and the actual ETR of the MNE group in each jurisdiction.\n\n4. **Safe Harbours and Exclusions:**\n   - Safe harbours are available to simplify compliance, allowing certain entities to treat their top-up amounts as nil.\n   - Three types of exclusions are recognized: International Shipping Income Exclusion, Substance-Based Income Exclusion (SBIE), and De Minimis Exclusion.\n\n5. **Compliance and Penalties:**\n   - Failure to comply with MTT and DTT obligations may result in penalties.\n   - The filing process is considered complete without the need for an assessment from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), although IRAS may audit returns.\n\n6. **Payment and Due Dates:**\n   - Payment for MTT and DTT is due one month after the filing deadline, with returns due 15 months after the end of each FY.\n   - If the MTT or DTT returns are not submitted on time, IRAS may estimate the tax payable.\n\n7. **Foreign Tax Credit (FTC):**\n   - FTC may be allowed for foreign DMTT paid or payable, provided certain conditions are met.\n   - FTC is not allowed for foreign GloBE taxes.\n\n8. **Record-Keeping:**\n   - Records must be kept for five years, with an extended period of up to ten years for documents related to GloBE computations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe MTT and DTT are significant components of Singapore's tax framework for MNEs, aimed at ensuring a minimum level of taxation on global profits. Compliance with these regulations will require careful record-keeping, timely filings, and an understanding of the various exclusions and safe harbours available under the GloBE rules.",

        "text": "Tax Treatment of Gains or Losses from the Sale of Foreign Assets\n\nThis e-Tax Guide explains the income tax treatment of gains or losses from the sale or disposal of any movable or immovable property situated outside Singapore, referred to as \u201cforeign asset.\u201d It is relevant to entities that derive gains or losses from the sale of foreign assets.\n\nCurrently, gains from the sale of foreign assets that are capital in nature are not taxable. To address international tax avoidance risks related to non-taxation of disposal gains in the absence of real economic activities, Singapore has amended its foreign-sourced income regime to subject foreign-sourced disposal gains to tax under specific circumstances. The amendment aligns with Singapore\u2019s focus on anchoring substantive economic activities in Singapore and its longstanding policy to align key areas of its tax regime with international norms.\n\nSingapore will treat gains from the sale or disposal of foreign assets as income chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1947 if the gains are not otherwise chargeable to tax under section 10(1) of the ITA or the gains are otherwise exempt from tax under the ITA. Such gains are referred to as \u201cforeign-sourced disposal gains.\u201d Foreign-sourced disposal gains will be chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(g) of the ITA when the gains are received in Singapore from outside Singapore by a covered entity and the covered entity that derived the gains does not have adequate economic substance in Singapore or the gains are derived from a disposal of foreign Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs).\n\nThe changes will apply to the sale or disposal of a foreign asset that occurs on or after 1 January 2024.\n\nPrior to 1 January 2024, Singapore taxes gains from the sale or disposal of assets as income when the gains are revenue in nature, regardless of whether the income is Singapore-sourced or foreign-sourced. Whether a gain from the sale or disposal of an asset is treated as capital or revenue in nature is determined based on the facts or circumstances of each case and with reference to established case law principles.\n\nFrom 1 January 2024, under the new foreign-sourced disposal gains tax regime, foreign-sourced disposal gains received in Singapore by an entity of a relevant group from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset will be treated as income chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(g) of the ITA under certain circumstances. The foreign-sourced disposal gains will be subject to tax if the entity does not have adequate economic substance in Singapore or the gains are from the disposal of a foreign IPR.\n\nForeign-sourced disposal gains are regarded as received in Singapore and chargeable to tax if they are remitted to, or transmitted or brought into, Singapore; applied in or towards satisfaction of any debt incurred in respect of a trade or business carried on in Singapore; or applied to the purchase of any movable property which is brought into Singapore. Generally, the foreign-sourced disposal gains are deemed to be received in Singapore only if such gains belong to an entity that is located in Singapore.\n\nOnly entities of relevant groups, referred to as \u201ccovered entities,\u201d will be within the scope of section 10L of the ITA. An entity is a member of a group of entities if its assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and cash flows are included in the consolidated financial statements of the parent entity of the group or excluded from the consolidated financial statements of the parent entity solely on size or materiality grounds or on the grounds that the entity is held for sale.\n\nA group is a relevant group if the entities of the group are not all incorporated, registered, or established in Singapore or any entity of the group has a place of business outside Singapore. A group with only Singapore entities that operates only in Singapore will not fall within the scope of section 10L of the ITA.\n\nThe gains from the sale or disposal of any movable or immovable property situated outside Singapore of a covered entity will be subject to tax under section 10L of the ITA. Common examples where assets are determined to be situated outside Singapore include immovable property situated outside Singapore, equity securities and debt securities registered in a foreign exchange, unlisted shares issued by a company incorporated outside Singapore, loans where the creditor is a resident in a jurisdiction outside Singapore, and IPRs where the owner is a resident in a jurisdiction outside Singapore.\n\nSection 10L of the ITA will not apply to gains from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset (not being a foreign IPR) when it is carried out as part of, or incidental to, the business activities of certain licensed entities or carried out as part of, or incidental to, the business activities or operations of an entity incentivized under specific tax incentives in Singapore. It will also not apply if the entity is able to meet the economic substance requirement in Singapore.\n\nForeign-sourced disposal gains from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset will not be brought to tax if the entity has adequate economic substance in the basis period in which the sale or disposal occurs. The economic substance requirement will be assessed at the entity level.\n\nA pure equity-holding entity is one whose function is to hold shares or equity interests in any other entity and has no income other than dividends or similar payments from the shares or equity interests, gains on the sale or disposal of the shares or equity interests, or income incidental to its activities of holding shares or equity interests. To meet the economic substance requirement, the entity must submit required returns, have operations managed and performed in Singapore, and have adequate human resources and premises in Singapore.\n\nA non-pure equity-holding entity is one that is not a pure equity-holding entity. The economic substance requirement will be determined based on an analysis of the entity\u2019s core income generating activities in Singapore. To meet the economic substance requirement, the entity must have operations managed and performed in Singapore and have adequate economic substance in Singapore.\n\nThe economic substance requirement takes into account outsourcing arrangements where an entity outsources some or all of its economic activities to third parties or group entities. For an outsourcing arrangement to satisfy the economic substance requirement, the economic activities must be carried out by the outsourced entity in Singapore, the outsourcing entity must have direct and effective control over the outsourced activities, and the outsourced entity must set aside dedicated resources to provide the outsourced services.\n\nThe tax treatment of gains from the sale or disposal of foreign IPRs is different from that of other foreign assets. The non-taxation of foreign-sourced disposal gains for entities is not applicable to gains from the disposal of foreign IPRs. For gains from the sale or disposal of qualifying foreign IPRs, a modified nexus approach is used to determine the extent of such gains that will not be taxable when received in Singapore.\n\nThe modified nexus ratio is calculated based on qualifying Research and Development (R&D) expenditure incurred in respect of the qualifying IPR to which the qualifying IP income disposal gains relate. For non-qualifying foreign IPRs, the full amount of the gains from the sale or disposal of the IPRs will be subject to tax when such gains are received in Singapore.\n\nThe following deductions may be allowed to ascertain the amount of gains from the sale or disposal of foreign assets chargeable to tax in Singapore: any expenditure incurred by the entity to acquire, create or improve the foreign asset; to protect or preserve the value of the foreign asset; or to sell or dispose of the foreign asset. The expenditure will include expenses incurred to finance the acquisition, creation, and improvement of the foreign asset.\n\nWhere the sale or disposal of a foreign asset by the entity was at a price less than the open-market price for the foreign asset, the Comptroller may treat the amount of the gains received in Singapore as the actual amount received plus the open-market price minus the actual price for the sale or disposal of the foreign asset.\n\nThe foreign-sourced disposal gains received in Singapore may have been taxed in the foreign jurisdiction before the gains are received in Singapore. A Singapore tax resident entity may claim double taxation relief, unilateral tax credit, or elect for the foreign tax credit pooling system when claiming the foreign tax credit to alleviate the foreign tax suffered on the foreign-sourced disposal gains.\n\nTax exemption under section 13(1)(zu) of the ITA will be given on the capital gains derived from the sale or disposal of a foreign asset where the gains are assessable as the income of an individual. Tax exemption will not be given if the gains are business revenue gains.\n\nTo ensure that entities keep track of the gains/losses from the disposal of foreign assets and accurately report their taxes, they are required to provide specific information with respect to such gains/losses in their tax computations when submitting their annual income tax returns. Entities are required to retain all records reasonably required for the Comptroller to ascertain the amount of net gains from the disposal of foreign assets chargeable to tax.\n\nYou may make an application for advance ruling to seek certainty on the adequacy of economic substance when a proposed sale or disposal of foreign assets is expected to occur. The advance ruling on the adequacy of economic substance, if issued, may be valid for up to five years, including the year relating to the basis period in which the proposed sale or disposal of foreign assets is envisaged to take place.\n\nFor general enquiries or clarifications on this e-Tax guide, please call 1800 356 8622.",

        "text": "Securities Lending and Repurchase Arrangements\n\nThis e-Tax Guide gives details on the income tax treatments and tax concessions of qualifying securities lending and repurchase (\u201crepo\u201d) arrangements under section 10H of the Income Tax Act 1947 (\u201cITA\u201d). It is relevant to any person who engages in securities lending and repo arrangements.\n\nWhen a person needs certain securities for the purpose of covering a short sale, it can enter into a securities lending arrangement to borrow the securities. It is obliged to provide collateral and return the borrowed securities at a later date. On the other hand, when a person has certain securities but needs cash, it can enter into a securities repo arrangement to sell the securities for cash with the agreement that the securities will be sold back to it at a later date. Both arrangements involve transferring ownership of the securities but only temporarily. If the arrangement is a qualifying arrangement, the person who originally owns the securities will not be treated as having sold the securities.\n\nBriefly, this is the tax position for qualifying arrangements: \n\nFor a securities lending arrangement, the lender does not recognize a gain or loss from the transfer of securities, while the borrower does recognize a gain or loss. For a securities repo arrangement, the seller does not recognize a gain or loss from the transfer of securities, while the buyer does recognize a gain or loss.\n\nThis e-Tax Guide replaces the IRAS e-Tax Guide on \u201cIRAS Guide on Securities Lending and Repurchase (\u201cREPO\u201d) Arrangement\u201d published on 23 November 2001.\n\nGlossary\n\nBorrowing fee: This is a fee payable by a borrower to a lender under a securities lending arrangement for the use of the borrowed securities.\n\nCompensatory payments: These refer to payments made by the transferee to the transferor which are of equal value to the distributions made in respect of the transferred securities or collateral that the transferee never receives.\n\nDistribution: This includes the distribution of any income paid under the transferred securities or collateral to the holder of the transferred securities or collateral.\n\nEquivalent securities: Equivalent securities (including securities used as collateral) are securities which are identical in type, nominal value, description, and amount to the transferred securities and collateral.\n\nLoan rebate fee: This is a fee payable by a lender to a borrower when the borrower provides cash collateral to the lender for the transferred securities under a securities lending arrangement.\n\nPrice differential: This is generally the difference between the sale and repurchase price under a securities repo arrangement and is payable by the seller to the buyer.\n\nSecurities lending arrangement: This is an arrangement where a person (\u201clender\u201d) lends its securities to another (\u201cborrower\u201d) in exchange for collateral. The borrower is obliged to return the transferred securities or their equivalent to the lender, either on the lender\u2019s demand or within the period of the arrangement.\n\nSecurities repo arrangement: This is an arrangement where a person (\u201cseller\u201d) sells its securities to another (\u201cbuyer\u201d) for cash and the buyer agrees to sell back the transferred securities or their equivalent at a specified price on an agreed future date or on the seller\u2019s demand.\n\nSingapore-based transferee: A Singapore-based transferee means a transferee who is resident in Singapore or who is not resident in Singapore but enters into the securities lending or repurchase arrangement through a permanent establishment in Singapore.\n\nSingapore-based transferor: A Singapore-based transferor means a transferor who is resident in Singapore or who is not resident in Singapore but enters into the securities lending or repurchase arrangement through a permanent establishment in Singapore.\n\nTransferee: This refers to a person who receives the transferred securities or collateral.\n\nTransferor: This refers to a person who transfers the securities (including securities used as collateral) to another person.\n\nTransferred collateral: These are securities which the borrower passes over to the lender as collateral under a securities lending arrangement.\n\nTransferred securities: These are securities which the lender passes over to the borrower under a securities lending arrangement or the seller passes over to the buyer under a securities repo arrangement.\n\nBackground\n\nA securities lending arrangement involves a lender and a borrower of securities. The lender would transfer the securities to the borrower. In return, the borrower would transfer cash or securities as collateral to the lender. When the borrower subsequently returns the transferred securities or their equivalent to the lender, the lender will return the transferred collateral or its equivalent to the borrower.\n\nIn a securities repo arrangement, the seller sells the securities to a buyer for cash with an agreement that the buyer would sell back the transferred securities or their equivalent to the seller at a later date. Both securities lending and repo arrangements, therefore, require the transfer of securities or collateral and the subsequent return of the transferred securities or collateral or their equivalent. Under the arrangements, legal titles change hands although the transferor continues to retain the economic ownership of the transferred securities or collateral.\n\nBased on ordinary tax rules, the gain or loss arising from the securities lending and repo arrangements is taxable or allowable in the hands of the transferor and transferee at each transfer if it is derived in the normal course of a business or trade.\n\nQualifying securities lending and repo arrangements\n\nIf the securities lending and repo arrangements were qualifying arrangements, instead of applying the general tax position, the tax treatment and concessions explained would apply. These tax treatment and concessions apply to qualifying securities lending and repo arrangements entered into on or after 23 November 2001.\n\nSecurities lending and repo arrangements are treated as qualifying arrangements when the following conditions are satisfied: the transferred securities or collateral do not involve stocks or shares of unlisted Singapore resident companies; and the transferor continues to bear the risks and retains the economic ownership of the transferred securities or collateral during the period of the securities lending or repo arrangement.\n\nWith effect from 27 November 2024, the scope of qualifying securities lending and repo arrangements is expanded by removing the condition regarding the types of securities that can be transferred under a qualifying securities lending and repo arrangement. The tax treatment of all distribution income from transferred securities or collateral will also be aligned with that for dividend and interest income.\n\nEconomic ownership\n\nThe requirements for economic ownership are not limited to the transferor\u2019s entitlement to the distributions on the transferred securities or collateral. The transferor is considered to have retained the economic ownership of the transferred securities or collateral if certain elements are present in a securities lending or repo arrangement.\n\nThe factors include the structure of the arrangement being documented in writing, the transferor continuing to assume the risks and retain the rewards, the transferee passing on the distributions or making compensatory payments, the transferor not disposing of the right to receive any part of the total consideration payable under the securities lending or repo arrangement, the transferor and transferee transacting on an arm\u2019s length basis, and the transferee acquiring the securities for acceptable commercial reasons.\n\nTax treatment of gain/loss from transfer of securities or collateral under qualifying securities lending and repo arrangements\n\nUnder a qualifying securities lending or repo arrangement, the transferor retains economic ownership of the transferred securities or collateral. The transferor only temporarily allows the transferee to use the transferred securities or collateral. Accordingly, for income tax purposes, no gain or loss will be recognized when the transferor transfers the transferred securities or collateral to the transferee, and when the transferee subsequently re-transfers the equivalent securities to the transferor.\n\nThere is no specific maximum period imposed on a securities lending or repo arrangement to qualify for this tax treatment. However, when an actual disposal takes place, the transferor has to recognize the gain or loss. Actual disposal can arise under various situations, such as redemption of the transferred securities, directing the transferee to accept a takeover offer, instructing the transferee to sell the transferred securities to the issuer, default by either party, or termination of the arrangement.\n\nThe gain or loss from the actual disposal is taxable or deductible if the transferor carries on the transactions in the normal course of its trade or business. For any transfer of foreign securities under any securities lending and repo arrangement that occurs on or after 1 January 2024, any gain arising from the arrangement will be treated as income chargeable to tax if the transfer falls within the scope of the ITA.\n\nTax treatment for transferee\n\nA transferee may make a gain or loss from selling the transferred securities or collateral to another person other than the transferor, and from returning the equivalent securities to the transferor subsequently. The gain or loss is taxable or allowable if the transferee carries on these transactions in the normal course of its trade or business.\n\nThe securities lending and repo arrangement can be terminated under various events. When such an event takes place, the transferee is deemed to have returned the equivalent securities to the transferor and completed the arrangement. Consequently, the transferee is required to recognize the gain or loss.\n\nIn calculating the gain or loss, the transferee must first determine the market value of the transferred securities at the time he borrows them. This market value is then used as the cost of the transferred securities and the sale price of equivalent securities.\n\nTax treatment of actual distribution and compensatory payment arising from qualifying securities lending and repo arrangements\n\nIn order for a transferor to be considered as the economic owner of the transferred securities or collateral under a qualifying securities lending or repo arrangement, when a distribution is made in respect of the transferred securities or collateral, the transferee has to pass on such distribution to the transferor if the transferee receives the distribution, or make a payment of equal value to the distribution to the transferor if the transferee does not receive the distribution.\n\nThis requirement is consistent with the terms of standard market agreements. However, in order not to prevent or discourage buy/sell trades in repo markets where compensatory payments are not made, the transferee is not required to make compensatory payment if the repo arrangement relates to Singapore Government Securities or qualifying debt securities.\n\nWhen an actual distribution in respect of the transferred securities or collateral in the hands of a Singapore-based transferee is passed on by the transferee to a transferor, the Singapore-based transferee will not be taxed on the actual distribution received, will not be allowed a deduction for the passing on of the distribution, is not entitled to any tax credit for any foreign tax suffered on an actual distribution received outside Singapore, and must withhold and pay the withheld tax to IRAS when passing on an actual distribution to any non-resident non Singapore-based transferor if the distribution is in respect of certain types of securities.\n\nThe transferor is regarded as the recipient of the actual distribution made in respect of the transferred securities or collateral. As such, the transferor will be taxed on the distribution passed on by the transferee to it.\n\nTax treatment of compensatory payment made by transferee\n\nA transferee may not always hold the transferred securities or collateral for the entire period of the securities lending or repo arrangement. The transferee could have delivered them to meet its short selling obligation or transferred them under another arrangement. As such, the transferee could not have received any actual distributions on the transferred securities or collateral. However, the transferee should still make a compensatory payment to the transferor. The transferee will be allowed a deduction for such payment if it is a revenue expense wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of the transferee\u2019s income.\n\nThe transferor will be taxed on the compensatory payment as follows: all compensatory payments will be taxed at the same tax rate that would have applied to the distribution had it been made directly to the transferor. Where a compensatory payment is in place of any distribution derived from outside Singapore, no tax credit will be allowed to a transferor resident in Singapore as no actual foreign tax had been suffered by the Singapore-based transferee.\n\nTax treatment of other related payments\n\nWhere the borrowing fee, loan rebate fee, price differential, or interest payment derived from collateral is borne directly or indirectly by a resident of or permanent establishment in Singapore or is deductible against any income accruing in or derived from Singapore, they would be deemed to be derived from Singapore and hence, subject to Singapore tax. Singapore withholding tax is applicable if these payments are payable or paid to non-resident transferor or transferee, unless tax exemption or waiver of obligation to withhold tax is granted.\n\nThe deductibility of these payments is subject to the existing tax rules.\n\nAdministrative requirements\n\nThe transferor and transferee, or their agent, have to maintain proper records of the securities lending or repo arrangement. Such records include documents showing distributions passed on, compensatory payments made, and economic ownership. The records are to be retained for a period of 5 years. Upon request, the transferor, transferee, or its agent is to submit full particulars of such records to the Comptroller of Income Tax.\n\nContact information\n\nIf you have any enquiries or need clarification on this e-Tax Guide, please call 1800-356 8622.\n\nUpdates and Amendments\n\nAmendments made on 29 June 2012 include updates to examples and the removal of references to provisions in the ITA that were repealed. Amendments made on 4 December 2024 include updates to the tax treatment of qualifying securities lending and repo arrangements and the expansion of the scope of qualifying arrangements.",
        "summary": "**Summary of Securities Lending and Repurchase Arrangements Tax Guide**\n\nThis e-Tax Guide outlines the income tax treatments and concessions for qualifying securities lending and repurchase (repo) arrangements under section 10H of the Income Tax Act 1947 (ITA) in Singapore. It is applicable to individuals and entities engaging in these arrangements.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Securities Lending Arrangement**: A lender provides securities to a borrower in exchange for collateral, with the obligation to return the securities later.\n- **Securities Repo Arrangement**: A seller sells securities to a buyer for cash, agreeing to repurchase them later.\n\n### Tax Treatment:\n1. **Qualifying Arrangements**: \n   - If arrangements meet specific criteria (e.g., not involving stocks of unlisted Singapore resident companies and the transferor retaining economic ownership), they are classified as qualifying arrangements.\n   - Under qualifying arrangements, no gain or loss is recognized for the transferor upon the transfer of securities or collateral. The transferor retains economic ownership.\n\n2. **Tax Implications**:\n   - **Transferor**: No gain or loss is recognized during the transfer of securities. However, upon actual disposal (e.g., redemption, default, or termination), the transferor must recognize any gain or loss.\n   - **Transferee**: Gains or losses from selling transferred securities or returning equivalent securities are taxable if conducted in the normal course of business.\n\n3. **Distributions and Compensatory Payments**:\n   - If a distribution occurs on transferred securities, the transferee must pass it on to the transferor or make a compensatory payment of equal value if no distribution is received.\n   - The transferor is taxed on the distribution passed on by the transferee, while the transferee can deduct compensatory payments if they are revenue expenses.\n\n4. **Other Payments**:\n   - Payments such as borrowing fees, loan rebate fees, and price differentials are subject to Singapore tax if borne by a resident or permanent establishment in Singapore.\n   - Withholding tax may apply to payments made to non-residents unless exemptions are granted.\n\n### Administrative Requirements:\n- Proper records must be maintained by both parties for at least five years, detailing distributions, compensatory payments, and economic ownership.\n\n### Updates:\n- The guide has been updated to reflect changes in tax treatment and the scope of qualifying arrangements, effective from 27 November 2024.\n\nFor further inquiries, individuals can contact the IRAS helpline at 1800-356 8622.",

        "text": "GST: Guide for Motor Vehicle Traders\n\nThis guide is for GST registered businesses selling new and/or second-hand motor vehicles. The purposes of this guide are to explain the GST treatment applicable to motor vehicle traders and to illustrate the GST computations for the sale of motor vehicles.\n\nThe business activities of a motor vehicle trader include the importation of motor vehicles, sale of new and used vehicles, and sale of motor vehicle bodies of de-registered vehicles. All motor vehicles in Singapore must be registered with LTA. To curb the growth of vehicle population in Singapore, LTA imposes regulatory charges on the sale of new vehicles. Regulatory charges do not attract GST as they do not relate to the provision of goods or services. All other charges or payments received in relation to a supply of motor vehicles are subject to GST. The GST treatment for the sale of a new motor vehicle differs from that of a second-hand motor vehicle. For the sale of a new vehicle, GST is chargeable on the selling price of the motor vehicle excluding regulatory charges such as COE. For the sale of a second-hand motor vehicle, the computation of the GST chargeable depends on whether the sale is made under the Gross Margin Scheme or the Discounted Sale Price Scheme.\n\nIf you are not a motor vehicle trader, you should use the Discounted Sale Price Scheme when you occasionally sell a second-hand vehicle that has been used in your business.\n\nARF denotes Additional Registration Fee. AFC denotes Additional Flat Component. CIF denotes Cost, Insurance and Freight. COE denotes Certificate of Entitlement. The Discounted Sale Price Scheme is a scheme for the sale of a second-hand motor vehicle whereby GST is charged on 50% of the selling price of the vehicle. The Gross Margin Scheme is a scheme for the sale of a second-hand motor vehicle whereby GST is charged on the difference between the selling price and the purchase price of the vehicle. LTA denotes Land Transport Authority. OPC schemes denote Off-Peak Car schemes. PARF denotes Preferential Additional Registration Fee. RF denotes Registration Fee. A second-hand vehicle is a used motor vehicle which has been registered in Singapore. It excludes any used vehicle which was registered overseas. TCOE denotes Temporary Certificate of Entitlement.\n\nWhen you import motor vehicles from overseas, at the point of importation, GST is payable on the CIF value plus custom duties. You may be granted relief from paying GST on the importation of motor vehicles for certain situations (e.g., re-importing motor vehicles exported temporarily for repair) if you satisfy the import relief conditions. If you wish to obtain relief from paying GST, you must make an application to Singapore Customs before importing the vehicle or sending the vehicle overseas. \n\nFor the sale of motor vehicles to the public, you must display, advertise, publish or quote GST-inclusive prices. For example, you may advertise the GST-inclusive price of a vehicle as $158,533 (inclusive of ARF, COE and GST). This is so that the customer knows upfront the final price payable.\n\nWhen your customer buys a new vehicle, it comes with charges and fees which include ARF, COE, RF and Road Tax (which may include AFC). These are charges imposed by LTA on vehicle buyers and do not attract GST as they do not relate to the provision of goods or services. If you include the ARF, COE, RF and Road Tax in your selling price of the new vehicle, GST is to be charged on the Selling Price less ARF, COE, RF and Road Tax paid to LTA.\n\nWhen you sell a car registered under the Revised Off-Peak Car (ROPC) scheme, you should not deduct the full value of ARF and COE from the selling price of the car when computing the value on which GST is to be charged. You should deduct only the net amount of ARF and COE paid to LTA (i.e., ARF and COE less ROPC scheme rebate).\n\nIf you offer discounts on COE to your customers, the COE to be deducted from the selling price of the vehicle for the purpose of computing the GST chargeable is the COE quota premium and not the discounted price of COE. \n\nUpon scrapping a car that is less than 10 years old, your customer may get a PARF/COE rebate. PARF/COE rebates can be used to offset various taxes and fees (e.g., RF, ARF, COE Quota Premium) for a new vehicle. Whether the selling price that you quote to your customer for the new vehicle is before or after deducting the PARF/COE rebate, the amount of GST chargeable is the same.\n\nIf you sell a new vehicle as a replacement vehicle under the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS), the COE value of the new replacement vehicle is the sum of the discounted Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP) payable and the COE rebate (if any) of the existing vehicle.\n\nFor GST purposes, the sale of a motor vehicle under a hire-purchase agreement results in two separate supplies. That is, you are supplying the vehicle to the finance company, which in turn supplies the vehicle to the customer (i.e., hirer) at the same price. Therefore, you must account for GST on the selling price of the vehicle (excluding ARF, COE, RF and Road Tax) as reflected on your tax invoice to the finance company.\n\nFor GST purposes, a second-hand vehicle excludes any used vehicle which was previously registered overseas. This is because when a used vehicle from overseas is imported into Singapore, it is required to be registered and the owner will have to pay COE, ARF and other fees as if it is new. In addition, delivery mileage or the registration for road use does not turn a new vehicle into a second-hand vehicle. A vehicle is \u2018unused\u2019 until either it has been driven on the road following a retail sale or it has been appropriated by the dealer for his business.\n\nYou have the option of two schemes for the calculation of GST on your sale of second-hand vehicles \u2013 the Gross Margin Scheme and the Discounted Sale Price Scheme. If you wish to use the Gross Margin Scheme, please review your eligibility using the form, \u2018Self-Review of Eligibility and Declaration on Use of Gross Margin Scheme Form\u2019, from IRAS\u2019 website and submit the form after completion. You can only begin to apply the Gross Margin Scheme on your sales transactions from the date of submission of the form, based on your declaration that all the conditions of the scheme have been satisfied.\n\nIf you are in the business of selling second-hand vehicles, you can only use the Gross Margin Scheme for the sale of a second-hand vehicle if either one of the following conditions is satisfied: The vehicle was bought from a non-GST registered supplier (e.g., an individual) or the vehicle was bought from a GST-registered supplier who used the Gross Margin Scheme on the sale of the second-hand vehicle to you. You must obtain a sales invoice (not a tax invoice) from the supplier to support your purchase made under the Gross Margin Scheme.\n\nIf you cannot satisfy the conditions, you must charge GST based on the Discounted Sale Price Scheme and issue a tax invoice to your customer. You cannot claim input tax on vehicles purchased under the Gross Margin Scheme. Similarly, when you make a sale under the Gross Margin Scheme, your customer is not allowed to claim input tax on the vehicle. You must not issue a tax invoice to your customer. You can only issue a normal sales invoice containing the details described in the guide. The GST charged is not to be shown on the invoice.\n\nUnder the Gross Margin Scheme, you must account for GST on the difference between the selling price (which is treated as inclusive of GST) and the purchase price of the motor vehicle. If you sell a second-hand vehicle at a loss, no GST is to be accounted for. However, you must report the selling price of the vehicle in Box 1 (Total Value of Standard-rated Supplies) of your GST returns.\n\nUnder the Discounted Sale Price Scheme, GST is charged on 50% of the selling price of the vehicle. This is regardless of whether the vehicle is sold at a profit or loss. If you are a motor trader, you should use the Discounted Sale Price Scheme when you do not satisfy the requirements for the use of the Gross Margin Scheme on the sale of your second-hand vehicle or the customer is registered for GST.\n\nYou can apply the Gross Margin Scheme to the sale of a vehicle body to another motor vehicle trader if you satisfy either one of the following conditions: The vehicle was bought from a non-GST registered supplier (e.g., an individual) or the vehicle was bought from a GST-registered supplier who had used the Gross Margin Scheme on the sale made to you. You must obtain a sales invoice (not a tax invoice) from the supplier to support your purchase made under the Gross Margin Scheme.\n\nWhen you dismantle a vehicle into various parts and sell/scrap the dismantled vehicle parts, you must charge and account for GST on the full selling price of the vehicle parts. The Gross Margin Scheme cannot be applied to the sale of vehicle parts.\n\nIf you sell a TCOE to another motor vehicle trader, you have to account for GST on the profit or value-added element. Generally, when you collect a deposit that forms part payment of the price of a new vehicle, you should account for GST on the full deposit collected unless the deposit is collected for the purpose of bidding for COE.\n\nIn a trade-in situation, there are two separate supplies made: Your sale of the new vehicle to the customer and your customer\u2019s sale of the old vehicle to you. For your sale of the new vehicle, you should account for GST on the actual GST-inclusive selling price of the new vehicle, excluding ARF, COE, RF and Road Tax. \n\nIf you introduce customers who require hire-purchase financing to finance companies and receive a commission from the finance companies, you must account for GST on the commission earned. If you provide hire-purchase financing to your customers, GST is not chargeable on hire-purchase interest and this interest amount should be separately disclosed to the hirer.\n\nWhen you repossess a vehicle that has been sold under a hire-purchase agreement, there is no supply for GST purposes. Therefore, no GST is chargeable. When you subsequently sell the repossessed vehicle, the sale is treated as being made by the hirer. Therefore, if the hirer is a GST registered person, you must charge and account for GST on the sale on behalf of the hirer. If the hirer is not a GST registered person, you need not charge GST on the sale of the repossessed vehicle.\n\nYou act as an agent for general insurance companies. Upon selling a vehicle, you introduce your customer to the insurance companies for insurance coverage. For the insurance premium paid by your customer, you do not have to charge GST as you are only acting on behalf of the insurance companies. If the insurance companies are registered for GST, they will impose GST on the insurance premiums. You do not need to charge another GST on the premiums collected on behalf of the insurance companies.\n\nWhen a customer buys a new car and requests for accessories, you must charge and account for GST when you recover the cost of the accessories from the customer. If you have incurred GST on the purchase of the accessories, you can claim the GST incurred as input tax. You must account for GST on all your supplies of services made in the course of your business. These include handling charges, collection fees, administration fees, agreement fees and commission. Interest collected from late payment is not subject to GST as it is an exempt supply.\n\nAs part of your sales promotion, you offer free accessories to your customers. You need not account for GST on the free gifts as the cost of the \u2018free gifts\u2019 would have already been included in the selling price of the vehicle sold. If you offer free warranties to your customers, you need not account for GST on goods and services provided free of charge during the warranty period. This is because the free warranties are already included in the selling price of the vehicle, for which GST has been accounted for.\n\nIf you have paid GST for your business purchases, including imports, you are entitled to claim the input tax incurred if you meet all the conditions for claiming input tax. Pre-registration GST is the GST that businesses incur on supplies of goods or services made to them before they are registered for GST. Pre-registration GST is allowable only to the extent that the goods or services acquired are used or will be used for taxable supplies made after GST registration.\n\nOnce you are de-registered from GST registration, a final GST return will be issued to you to file and account for GST up till the last day of the GST registration. In your GST return, you only need to account for output tax based on 50% of the Open Market Value for used vehicles.\n\nIt is the responsibility of business owners and company directors to ensure that proper records are kept. You are expected to put in place a record keeping system to ensure that your GST declarations are duly supported with the required documents. The types of records you need to keep include source documents that substantiate all transactions in your business, records of the steps taken to ascertain whether the supply made to you or by you was a part of a Missing Trader Fraud arrangement, accounting records and schedules, bank statements, and any other records of transactions connected with your business.\n\nFor enquiries on this e-Tax Guide, please contact the Goods and Services Tax Division at the IRAS website.",

        "text": "This e-Tax guide provides details on the features and refund mechanism of the Electronic Tourist Refund Scheme (eTRS). This includes the conditions that retailers participating in the eTRS must comply with. You should read this guide if you are participating or intend to participate in the eTRS either by engaging the services of a Central Refund Agency (CRA) or operating on your own as an Independent Retailer (IR).\n\nTourists may obtain a refund of GST on goods purchased from GST-registered retailers who participate in the eTRS. The refund is allowed only on goods brought out of Singapore via Changi International Airport or Seletar Airport, within 2 months from the date of purchase and subject to the tourists\u2019 eligibility and conditions of the Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS). The eTRS is a voluntary scheme. Retailers who wish to participate in the eTRS can either engage the services of a CRA or operate the eTRS on their own as IRs. For information on the participation conditions under eTRS, retailers can refer to the e-Tax guide, \u201cGST: The Electronic Tourist Refund Scheme (eTRS) (Refunds made on or after 4 Apr 2019)\u201d, on the IRAS website.\n\nThe eTRS allows your eligible customers to receive a refund of GST paid on goods that are purchased and brought out of Singapore by them via the airports. A Central Refund Agency (CRA) provides GST refund services to tourists on behalf of a retailer. Retailers who wish to participate in the eTRS but do not wish to operate the eTRS on their own can get themselves affiliated with a CRA. Presently, there are 2 CRAs.\n\nIf you are participating in the eTRS, you must issue the eTRS transaction for the tourist. The eTRS transaction contains the tourist and purchase details for subsequent retrieval at the self-help kiosk. You must not issue any other physical forms for eTRS under any circumstances. Details that must be captured for issuing an eTRS transaction include receipt number, receipt issuing date & time, receipt gross amount, purchase items, tourist passport number, and tourist nationality.\n\nA visitor to Singapore may obtain a refund of GST under the eTRS on goods purchased by the visitor if they meet the following criteria as a tourist: The visitor is 16 years of age or above on the date of the purchase; The visitor is not a citizen or a permanent resident of Singapore; The visitor is not a member of the crew of an aircraft on which it is departing Singapore; and The visitor is not a Specified Person.\n\nTo participate in the eTRS as an IR, you must comply with all the conditions set out in the e-Tax guide. Some of the conditions are as follows: Be GST-registered; Has good tax compliance and payment records; Has good internal controls and proper accounting and record keeping; and You must make a refund to the tourist within 3 months after the date the application of the tourist for the refund is approved.\n\nYour customer may qualify for a tourist refund if the following conditions are satisfied: Purchase the goods, request you to capture their information and issue an eTRS transaction for tourist refund; Spend at least SGD100 (including GST); Present original passport and valid electronic Visit Pass in person to you; Apply for their GST refund at the eTRS self-help kiosk at the airports; Depart with the goods within 2 months from the date of purchase; and Claim the refund from the approved central refund counter operator within 2 months from the date of approval of the application.\n\nAll standard-rated goods are eligible for the refund except for goods wholly or partly consumed in Singapore, goods exported for business or commercial purposes, goods that will be exported by freight, and accommodation in a hotel or similar establishments. The eTRS is strictly for the sale of goods only and cannot be used for services supplied to customers.\n\nAt the point of sale, you must issue an invoice or receipt with GST at the prevailing tax rate to your customer. When a customer requests for an eTRS transaction, you must inform the customer of the tourist refund conditions and check if they meet the conditions; sight the passport provided; capture the person\u2019s passport number, nationality, and purchase details electronically; advise the tourist to keep the invoice or receipt; and indicate on their invoice or receipt that an eTRS transaction has been issued.\n\nIf you are affiliated with a CRA, you should not claim any eTRS refund from IRAS as you are not the one making the refund to tourists. Instead, your CRA will claim the refund from IRAS after paying the refund made to tourists. If you are not affiliated with any CRA and are operating the eTRS on your own, you can claim the amount refunded to the tourist from the Comptroller.\n\nYou must charge GST at the prevailing GST rate on all sales made under the eTRS. Even if you choose to absorb the GST on the sale, you must still account for output tax in your GST return for the prescribed accounting period in which the sale takes place. You must report the value of sale in Box 1 \u201cTotal value of standard-rated supplies\u201d and the corresponding GST collected in Box 6 \u201cOutput tax due\u201d.\n\nAs you or the CRA would be deducting an amount from the refund due to cover administrative or handling expenses, you should explain this charge clearly to the tourist at the point of sale. The administrative fee is a consideration for a supply of service to the tourist. Generally, a supply of service can be zero-rated if it qualifies as an international service.\n\nIf you are operating the eTRS as an IR, it is important to maintain certain documents for at least 5 years to prove to the Comptroller that you have satisfied all the conditions. These include a separate account to record sales and refunds made under the eTRS, copies of invoices and receipts issued, reports issued by the Central Clearing House, and evidence or CRC report on the payment made to the tourist.\n\nYou must display a notice prominently at your retail outlet to indicate that a tourist must present their passport in person before an eTRS transaction can be issued. You must show the descriptions of the goods purchased under the eTRS on the invoice or receipt. You must verify the eligibility of the tourist in person at the time of issuing the eTRS transaction. The eTRS is only applicable to an eligible tourist who visits Singapore and is the purchaser of the goods.\n\nIf a tourist returns goods before submitting a refund claim, you must check and confirm with the relevant CRA that no approval has been granted on the eTRS transaction previously issued, void the eTRS transaction, re-issue a new eTRS transaction for the remaining purchased item, and refund the value of goods returned to the tourist. If all goods are returned before the tourist submits a refund claim, you must void the eTRS transaction and refund the total value of goods returned to the tourist.\n\nIn the event of retailer contingency, the retailer will need to follow the respective CRA\u2019s or IR\u2019s contingency process. You should only use the retailer contingency process in specified situations and adhere strictly to the applicable procedure to minimize any operational impact and inconvenience to the tourists.\n\nYou should put in place some form of controls to ensure the eTRS is not misused. Suggested controls include maintaining a record of staff who issue eTRS transactions, maintaining a record of the eTRS transactions issued, and requiring store manager\u2019s approval before issuing an eTRS transaction involving a high value amount.\n\nIf you choose to participate in the eTRS, you must comply with the conditions laid out in the GST (General) Regulations, this e-Tax guide, and those made known to you through your CRA. Failure to do so may result in the termination of your affiliation and participation in eTRS. The TRS is available only to bona fide tourists for the claiming of GST refunds on goods they have purchased and brought out of Singapore. It is an offence for a person to obtain GST refunds if they do not meet the TRS qualifying criteria and conditions.\n\nTourists can obtain more information by referring to IRAS\u2019 website, CRC\u2019s website, STB\u2019s website, or Singapore Customs website.

Broadly, the GloBE rules apply to a multinational group (MNE group) that has a consolidated group revenue of at least EUR 750 million annually in at least 2 of the 4 preceding financial years.\n\nPart 1 defines the terms used in the Bill.\n\nPart 2 provides for a multinational enterprise top-up tax (MTT). A constituent entity of an MNE group that is located in Singapore is liable to pay MTT if it holds an ownership interest in another constituent entity located in another jurisdiction and the constituent entities located in that jurisdiction have an effective tax rate that is less than a minimum rate of 15%. Such a constituent entity is called a chargeable entity. Broadly, the amount of MTT payable by a chargeable entity is the sum of the top-up amounts computed for each of those constituent entities that it holds an ownership interest in. MTT is generally not applicable if an equivalent top-up tax is paid elsewhere by a constituent entity that is a parent entity of the chargeable entity.",
        "summary": "**Summary of the Multinational Enterprise (Minimum Tax) Act 2024**\n\nThe **Multinational Enterprise (Minimum Tax) Act 2024** was enacted in Singapore to implement the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar 2) from the OECD/G20 framework. This legislation introduces a **Minimum Tax** framework aimed at multinational enterprises (MNEs) with consolidated group revenues of at least EUR 750 million in at least two of the last four financial years.\n\n### Key Provisions:\n\n1. **Definitions and Scope**:\n   - The Act defines critical terms such as \"flow-through entity,\" \"permanent establishment,\" and \"MNE group.\"\n   - It specifies the jurisdictions where entities or their permanent establishments are located.\n\n2. **Minimum Tax Rate**:\n   - A minimum effective tax rate of **15%** is established. Entities with effective tax rates below this threshold will be subject to a **Multinational Enterprise Top-up Tax (MTT)**.\n\n3. **Chargeable Entities**:\n   - A **chargeable entity** is defined as a constituent entity of an MNE group located in Singapore that holds an ownership interest in another entity in a jurisdiction with an effective tax rate below the minimum rate.\n\n4. **Calculation of MTT**:\n   - The MTT payable by a chargeable entity is calculated based on the top-up amounts for each of the constituent entities it owns that are located in jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates.\n\n5. **Registration and Compliance**:\n   - MNE groups must register with the Comptroller of Income Tax, designating local filing entities for **GloBE information returns** and MTT/DTT returns.\n   - There are penalties for failure to register or comply with reporting requirements.\n\n6. **Returns and Payments**:\n   - The Act outlines the process for filing returns and making payments for MTT and DTT (Domestic Top-up Tax).\n   - It includes provisions for information-gathering powers to ensure compliance.\n\n7. **Assessments and Appeals**:\n   - The Act establishes procedures for tax assessments, objections, and appeals to the Board of Review or the General Division of the High Court.\n\n8. **Offences and Penalties**:\n   - Failure to file returns, maintain records, or provide accurate information may result in penalties, including serious fraudulent tax evasion.\n\n9. **Miscellaneous Provisions**:\n   - The Act includes provisions for the liability of managers, duties of liquidators, and the application of other income tax provisions.\n\n### Related Amendments:\nThe Act also amends the **Income Tax Act 1947** to incorporate definitions and provisions relevant to the MTT and DTT.\n\n### Implementation Timeline:\nThe MTT will be phased in with specific rates for financial years beginning from 2023 to 2032, gradually decreasing from 10% to 5% by 2032.\n\nThis legislation aims to ensure that multinational enterprises contribute a minimum level of tax, thereby addressing base erosion and profit shifting practices.",

or\n\n(d) a place of business (or a deemed place of business under the law of the jurisdiction where the main entity is located) that is not one in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), through which operations are conducted outside the jurisdiction where the main entity is located, but only if the law of that jurisdiction exempts from tax income attributable to such operations.\n\n(2) In this Act, a \u201cmain entity\u201d is the entity that includes the FANIL of its permanent establishment in its financial statements.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this Act, a permanent establishment is treated as an entity that is distinct from the main entity it is a permanent establishment of (whether or not that is the case) and any other permanent establishment of the main entity.\n\n(4) Any right, obligation, debt or liability in this Act of a constituent entity that is a permanent establishment is that of its main entity.\n\nJurisdiction where entity or permanent establishment is located\n\n5.\u2014(1) For the purposes of this Act, an entity (not being a flow-through entity) is located in a jurisdiction if \u2014\n\n(a) it is a tax resident of that jurisdiction based on its place of management, establishment, incorporation, registration or similar criteria under the laws of that jurisdiction; or\n\n(b) in a case where it is not a tax resident of any jurisdiction \u2014 it is established, formed, incorporated or registered under the laws of that jurisdiction.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this Act, a flow-through entity that \u2014\n\n(a) is the ultimate parent entity of an MNE group;

and\n\n(c) in the case of a permanent establishment in section 4(1)(c) \u2014 it is situated in that jurisdiction.\n\n(5) A permanent establishment in section 4(1)(d) is considered a stateless permanent establishment.\n\nJurisdiction where entity is located: 2 or more jurisdictions\n\n6.\u2014(1) This section applies where an entity (X) is located in 2 or more jurisdictions in a financial year under section 5(1).\n\n(2) If there is an applicable tax treaty in force between 2 of these jurisdictions, X is located in the jurisdiction that it is deemed to be a resident of under that treaty.\n\n(3) If \u2014\n\n(a) the applicable tax treaty in subsection (2) requires the competent authorities of the 2 jurisdictions to reach a mutual agreement on the residence of the entity but no agreement exists, or that treaty does not provide relief or exemption from tax for X because it is a resident of both jurisdictions; or\n\n(b) there is no applicable tax treaty in force between the 2 jurisdictions,\n\nthen \u2014\n\n(c) X is located in the jurisdiction where it paid the greater amount of covered taxes, excluding any tax paid under a controlled foreign company tax regime, for the financial year;\n\n(d) if the amount of covered taxes paid by X in each jurisdiction for the financial year is the same or nil, X is located in the jurisdiction where it has the greater amount of substance-based income exclusion for the financial year as determined in accordance with section 18 for X as if X were the only constituent entity of its MNE group in that jurisdiction; and\n\n(e) if the amount of X\u2019s substance-based income exclusion mentioned in paragraph (d) for each jurisdiction for the financial year is the same or nil, X is treated as a stateless entity unless X is the ultimate parent entity of its MNE group, in which case X is located in the jurisdiction under the laws of which X is established, formed, incorporated or registered.\n\n(4) In subsection (2) or (3), if \u2014\n\n(a) one of the jurisdictions is Singapore;\n\n(b) X would (but for this subsection) be located in the other jurisdiction as a result of that subsection;\n\n(c) that other jurisdiction does not impose a qualified IIR for the financial year; and\n\n(d) X would be a chargeable entity under section 12 if it were located in Singapore for the financial year,\n\nthen X is located in Singapore for the financial year.\n\n(5) If the location of an entity changes in a financial year, it is located for that financial year in the jurisdiction where it is located at the beginning of that financial year.\n\n(6) In subsection (3)(c), \u201ccontrolled foreign company tax regime\u201d means any law (other than a law imposing MTT or a qualified IIR) under which an entity (A) with an ownership interest in another entity (B) located in a different jurisdiction from A, is subject to current taxation on A\u2019s share of part or all of B\u2019s income, whether or not any of that income is distributed to A.\n\nMinimum rate\n\n7. The minimum rate is 15%.\n\nMNE group to which this Act applies\n\n8.\u2014(1) This Act applies to an MNE group for a financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2025 if its consolidated group revenue (determined by reference to the consolidated financial statements of its ultimate parent entity) for at least 2 financial years out of the 4 financial years immediately before that financial year, is equal to or exceeds the threshold in subsection (2).\n\n(2) The threshold for a financial year is the amount computed by the formula A \u00d7 B \u00f7 12; where \u2014\n\n(a) A is EUR 750 million or its equivalent in other currency as determined under the regulations; and\n\n(b) B is the number of months in the financial year.\n\n(3) The Minister may make regulations under section 84 \u2014\n\n(a) to prescribe adjustments to be made to the consolidated group revenue of an MNE group for any financial year for the purpose of subsection (1) in the event of any prescribed change to the composition of the MNE group;

and\n\n(b) the amount in the presentation currency (not being euros) is then to be converted into euros in accordance with the regulations.\n\nAct to be construed as one with ITA\n\n10.\u2014(1) This Act charges taxes on the income of MNE groups, known as the MTT and the DTT.\n\n(2) This Act is to be construed as one with the ITA.\n\nPART 2\n\nMTT\n\nPurpose of this Part\n\n11.\u2014(1) The purpose of this Part is to implement the GloBE rules relating to the top-up tax under the income inclusion rule (IIR).\n\n(2) For that purpose, this Part makes provision for a tax payable in respect of a constituent entity located in a jurisdiction outside Singapore, or a stateless entity, of an MNE group to which this Act applies where, for a financial year \u2014\n\n(a) the effective tax rate for the constituent entities of the MNE group for that jurisdiction or for that stateless entity (as determined in accordance with this Part) is less than the minimum rate; and\n\n(b) any responsible member of the MNE group that holds an ownership interest in that entity is located in Singapore.\n\n(3) The tax is to be known as the \u201cmultinational enterprise top-up tax\u201d or \u201cMTT\u201d.\n\nEntity chargeable with MTT\n\n12. An entity (called in this Act a chargeable entity) is chargeable with MTT for a financial year if \u2014\n\n(a) the entity is a responsible member of an MNE group at any time in the financial year;\n\n(b) this Act applies to the MNE group for the financial year;\n\n(c) the entity holds an ownership interest in another constituent entity of the MNE group at any time in the financial year;\n\n(d) that other constituent entity is located in a jurisdiction outside Singapore or is a stateless entity, and has a top-up amount for the financial year (called in this Act a relevant entity); and\n\n(e) the entity is located in Singapore.\n\nResponsible members of MNE group\n\n13.\u2014(1) The ultimate parent entity of an MNE group is a responsible member of the MNE group if it is not an excluded entity and is \u2014\n\n(a) located in Singapore; or\n\n(b) subject to a qualified IIR under the law of the jurisdiction where it is located.\n\n(2) An intermediate parent entity (X) of an MNE group is a responsible member of the MNE group if \u2014\n\n(a) the ultimate parent entity of the MNE group is not a responsible member of the MNE group;\n\n(b) no constituent entity of the MNE group that holds a controlling interest in X is \u2014\n\n(i) located in Singapore; or\n\n(ii) subject to a qualified IIR under the law of the jurisdiction where it is located; and\n\n(c) X is \u2014\n\n(i) located in Singapore; or\n\n(ii) subject to a qualified IIR under the law of the jurisdiction where it is located.\n\n(3) A partially-owned parent entity (X) of an MNE group is a responsible member of the MNE group if \u2014\n\n(a) the ownership interests in X are not wholly held (directly or indirectly) by another partially-owned parent entity of the MNE group that is \u2014\n\n(i) located in Singapore; or\n\n(ii) subject to a qualified IIR under the law of the jurisdiction where it is located; and\n\n(b) X is \u2014\n\n(i) located in Singapore; or\n\n(ii) subject to a qualified IIR under the law of the jurisdiction where it is located.\n\nAmount of MTT chargeable on chargeable entity\n\n14.\u2014(1) Subject to subsection (2), the amount of MTT chargeable on a chargeable entity for a financial year is the sum of the top-up tax (determined in accordance with sections 15, 24 and 25) of each relevant entity of the chargeable entity for the financial year.\n\n(2) Where a chargeable entity (X) holds an indirect ownership interest in a relevant entity (Y) through another responsible member (Z) of the MNE group, the amount of MTT chargeable on X for the financial year is reduced (but not below nil) by the amount of MTT or qualified IIR chargeable for that financial year on Z in respect of the part of the top-up amount of Y that is attributable to X\u2019s indirect ownership interest in Y for that financial year.\n\nTop-up tax for relevant entity other than investment entity or insurance investment entity\n\n15.\u2014(1) In this Part, the top-up tax for a relevant entity (other than an investment entity or an insurance investment entity) of a chargeable entity for a financial year is the top-up amount of the relevant entity for the financial year multiplied by the chargeable entity\u2019s inclusion ratio for the entity for the financial year.\n\n(2) In this section, a chargeable entity\u2019s inclusion ratio for a relevant entity for a financial year is determined by the formula A \u00d7 B \u00f7 A; where \u2014\n\n(a) A is the GloBE income or loss of the relevant entity for the financial year; and\n\n(b) B is the GloBE income or loss of the relevant entity for the financial year that is attributable to entities other than the chargeable entity as determined under subsection (3).\n\n(3) In subsection (2), the GloBE income or loss of a relevant entity for a financial year that is attributable to entities other than the chargeable entity is the GloBE income or loss of the relevant entity that would have been treated in the chargeable entity\u2019s consolidated financial statements as attributable to those other entities, if the chargeable entity had prepared consolidated financial statements on the bases specified in subsection (4) (whether or not the chargeable entity had actually prepared such consolidated financial statements).\n\n(4) The bases mentioned in subsection (3) are as follows:\n\n(a) the ultimate parent entity of the MNE group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with an acceptable financial accounting standard, or an authorised financial accounting standard but only if adjustment is made to prevent any material competitive distortion from the application of such authorised standard;\n\n(b) the consolidated financial statements of the chargeable entity are prepared in accordance with the same accounting standards mentioned in paragraph (a);\n\n(c) the chargeable entity owns a controlling interest in the relevant entity such that the income and expenses of the relevant entity are consolidated on a line-by-line basis with those of the chargeable entity;\n\n(d) the relevant entity\u2019s net income is the amount of its GloBE income or loss;\n\n(e) all of the relevant entity\u2019s GloBE income or loss is attributable to transactions with persons that are not members of the MNE group;\n\n(f) any ownership interest in the relevant entity that is not held by the chargeable entity is held by persons that are not members of the MNE group.\n\n(5) For the purpose of subsection (2), where the relevant entity is a flow-through entity, the GloBE income or loss of the relevant entity excludes any amount that is allocated to an owner of the relevant entity who is not a member of the MNE group.\n\n(6) Where a relevant entity has a top-up amount for a financial year, but its GloBE income or loss for the financial year is nil or a negative amount, then, for the purpose of subsection (2), its GloBE income or loss for the financial year is deemed to be its top-up amount for the financial year divided by 15%.\n\nTop-up amounts of constituent entities other than special entities\n\n16.\u2014(1) In this Part, a constituent entity (not being a special entity) of an MNE group has a top-up amount for a financial year if the amount determined under subsection (2) or (3) is a positive amount, and that positive amount is considered the top-up amount of the constituent entity for the financial year.\n\n(2) If the sum of the GloBE income or loss for a financial year of all the constituent entities (not being special entities) of an MNE group located in a single jurisdiction is a positive amount, the top-up amount for that financial year of each of those constituent entities is determined by the formula A \u00d7 B \u00f7 C; where \u2014\n\n(a) A is the jurisdictional top-up amount (as determined in accordance with subsection (4)) for all of those constituent entities for that financial year;\n\n(b) B is the GloBE income or loss of the constituent entity for the financial year if the constituent entity has a positive amount of GloBE income or loss for that financial year, otherwise B is nil; and\n\n(c) C is the sum of the GloBE income or loss for the financial year of each of those constituent entities that has a positive amount of GloBE income or loss for that financial year.\n\n(3) If the sum of the GloBE income or loss for a financial year of all the constituent entities (not being special entities) of an MNE group located in a single jurisdiction is nil or a negative amount, the top-up amount for that financial year of each of those constituent entities is determined by any of the following formulae (whichever is applicable):\n\n(a) if those constituent entities have an additional current top-up amount under section 21(1) but not under section 21(4), for that financial year: A \u00d7 D \u00f7 E; where \u2014\n\n(i) A has the meaning given by subsection (2)(a);\n\n(ii) D is nil if the GloBE income or loss of the constituent entity for that financial year is a positive amount or the adjusted covered taxes for that constituent entity for that financial year is nil or a positive amount, otherwise D is the amount determined by multiplying the GloBE income or loss (being nil or a negative amount) of that constituent entity for that financial year by 15% and then deducting the adjusted covered taxes (being a negative amount) for that constituent entity for that financial year, except that if the resulting amount is negative, D is nil; and\n\n(iii) E is the sum of D for each of those constituent entities;\n\n(b) if those constituent entities have an additional current top-up amount under section 21(4) but not under section 21(1), and the recalculation in section 21(4) is only made for one previous financial year: A \u00d7 F \u00f7 G; where \u2014\n\n(i) A has the meaning given by subsection (2)(a);\n\n(ii) F is the GloBE income or loss of the constituent entity for the previous financial year, except that if the GloBE income or loss for the previous financial year is a negative amount, F is nil; and\n\n(iii) G is the sum of F for each of those constituent entities;\n\n(c) in any other case, in accordance with the applicable formula prescribed in the regulations.\n\nJurisdictional Top-Up Amount\n\n(4) In subsection (2), the jurisdictional top-up amount for the constituent entities (not being special entities) of an MNE group located in a jurisdiction for a financial year is determined by the formula (H \u00d7 I) + J \u2013 K, where \u2014\n\n(a) H is the top-up tax percentage for those constituent entities for that financial year as determined in accordance with subsection (5);\n\n(b) I is the excess profits of those constituent entities for that financial year as determined in accordance with subsection (6);\n\n(c) J is the additional current top-up amount as determined in accordance with section 21 for those constituent entities for that financial year; and\n\n(d) K is the qualified domestic minimum top-up tax imposed by the law of that jurisdiction in respect of those constituent entities for that financial year, but \u2014\n\n(i) excluding any amount contested in any judicial or administrative proceedings in that jurisdiction; or\n\n(ii) determined by the tax authority of that jurisdiction to be not assessable or collectible, on constitutional or similar grounds in that jurisdiction or any specific agreement with the government of that jurisdiction limiting the tax liability of those constituent entities; and\n\n(iii) including any amount excluded by a previous application of sub-paragraph (i) but determined to be payable for that financial year.\n\nTop-Up Tax Percentage\n\n(5) In subsection (4), the top-up tax percentage for the constituent entities (not being special entities) of an MNE group located in a jurisdiction for a financial year is determined by the formula L \u2013 M, where \u2014\n\n(a) L is the minimum rate; and\n\n(b) M is the effective tax rate for those constituent entities for that financial year as determined in accordance with section 17,\n\nand if the percentage so determined is nil or less, the top-up tax percentage for those constituent entities for that financial year is nil.\n\nExcess Profits\n\n(6) In subsection (4), the excess profits of the constituent entities (not being special entities) of an MNE group located in a jurisdiction for a financial year is determined by the formula N \u2013 O, where \u2014\n\n(a) N is the sum of the GloBE income or loss for that financial year of those constituent entities; and\n\n(b) O is the substance-based income exclusion for those constituent entities for that financial year as determined in accordance with section 18,\n\nand if the amount so determined is nil or less, the excess profits of those constituent entities for that financial year is nil.\n\nRegulations\n\n(7) The Minister may make regulations under section 84 to provide for \u2014\n\n(a) the recalculation, in a subsequent financial year, of the top-up amounts of the constituent entities of an MNE group for a financial year in accordance with the GloBE rules; and\n\n(b) the determination of the top-up amount of a constituent entity of an MNE group for a financial year in specified circumstances in accordance with the GloBE rules.\n\nEffective tax rate for constituent entities other than special entities\n\n17.\u2014(1) In this Part, the effective tax rate for the constituent entities (not being special entities) of an MNE group located in a jurisdiction for a financial year is determined by the formula A \u00f7 B \u00d7 100%; where \u2014\n\n(a) A is the sum of the adjusted covered taxes (including any negative amount of adjusted covered taxes) for that financial year of those constituent entities; and\n\n(b) B is the sum of the GloBE income or loss for that financial year of those constituent entities.\n\n(2) In subsection (1), if B is nil or a negative amount, the effective tax rate for those constituent entities for that financial year is 15%. \n\n(3) In subsection (1), if A is a negative amount and B is a positive amount \u2014\n\n(a) the effective tax rate for those constituent entities for that financial year is nil;

or\n\n(b) none of the constituent entities mentioned in subsection (1)(a)(iii) and (b)(iii),\n\nhad any adjusted revenue or GloBE income or loss for FY-1 or FY-2 (as the case may be), that financial year is disregarded in computing the average of the sums in subsection (1)(a) and (b).\n\n(3) For the purposes of subsection (1), if any financial year in that subsection is longer or shorter than a year, then \u2014\n\n(a) the sum of the adjusted revenues; or\n\n(b) the sum of the GloBE income or loss,\n\nof the constituent entities for that financial year is the amount arrived at by multiplying that sum by the amount given by dividing 365 by the number of days in that financial year.\n\n(4) If subsection (1) applies, and the filing entity of the MNE group so elects in a GloBE information return (whether filed in Singapore or another jurisdiction), the top-up amounts for that financial year of those constituent entities are deemed to be nil.\n\n(5) An election under subsection (4) must be made in accordance with the GloBE rules.\n\n(6) In this section, \u201cadjusted revenue\u201d, in relation to a constituent entity for a financial year, means the revenue of the constituent entity that is taken into account in its FANIL for the financial year after making the adjustments prescribed by the regulations.\n\nGloBE Safe Harbours\n\n20.\u2014(1) This section applies if \u2014\n\n(a) specified entities of an MNE group located in a jurisdiction are, in accordance with the regulations for applying a GloBE Safe Harbour, eligible for the GloBE Safe Harbour for a financial year; and\n\n(b) the filing entity of the MNE group elects in a GloBE information return (whether filed in Singapore or another jurisdiction) to apply that GloBE Safe Harbour for that jurisdiction for those entities for that financial year.\n\n(2) If subsection (1) applies, then, despite anything in this Part, the top-up amounts (or such parts thereof specified under the regulations) for that financial year of those entities are treated as nil.\n\n(3) An election is not effective for the purpose of subsection (1)(b) unless it is made \u2014\n\n(a) in accordance with the GloBE rules and the regulations;

and\n\n(c) after making all required recalculations in accordance with the regulations, section 19(1)(a) and (b) is not satisfied for the previous financial year,\n\nthen, for the purpose of calculating the additional current top-up amount for the current financial year, D in subsection (4) is treated as nil.\n\nTop-up amounts of stateless entities\n\n22.\u2014(1) In this Part, the top-up amount of a constituent entity that is a stateless entity is determined by applying sections 16, 17, 18 and 21 (and regulations made for the purposes of those sections) to the constituent entity as if it were the only constituent entity of the MNE group located in a jurisdiction, and for this purpose references to a constituent entity (not being a special entity) in those sections are references to the stateless entity.\n\n(2) For the purpose of applying section 18 under subsection (1), where a stateless entity has any payroll carve-out amount or tangible asset carve-out amount (as defined in section 18) for a financial year that is not allocated to another entity, the substance-based income exclusion for the stateless entity is treated as nil.\n\nTop-up amounts of minority-owned constituent entities and members of minority-owned subgroup\n\n23.\u2014(1) In this Part, the top-up amount of a constituent entity that is a minority-owned constituent entity (not being an investment entity or an insurance investment entity), and that is not a member of a minority-owned subgroup, is determined by applying sections 16, 17, 18, 20 and 21 (and regulations made for the purposes of those sections) to the constituent entity as if it were the only constituent entity of the MNE group located in the jurisdiction, and for this purpose references to a constituent entity (not being a special entity) in those sections are references to the constituent entity.\n\n(2) In this Part, the top-up amount of a constituent entity that is a member of a minority-owned subgroup is determined by applying sections 16, 17, 18, 20 and 21 (and regulations made for the purposes of those sections) to that entity as if references to a constituent entity (not being a special entity) in those sections were references to a member of the minority-owned subgroup, and references to an MNE group in those sections were references to the minority-owned subgroup.\n\nTop-up tax for investment entities and insurance investment entities\n\n24.\u2014(1) In this Part, the top-up tax for a financial year for a relevant entity of a chargeable entity that is an investment entity or insurance investment entity, is the top-up amount of the entity for the financial year.\n\n(2) In this Part, an investment entity or insurance investment entity has a top-up amount for a financial year if the amount determined under subsection (3) or (4) is a positive amount.\n\n(3) If the sum of the allocable GloBE income or loss for a financial year of all constituent entities of an MNE group that are investment entities or insurance investment entities located in a single jurisdiction is a positive amount, the top-up amount for that financial year of each of those entities is determined by the formula A \u00d7 B \u00f7 C; where \u2014\n\n(a) A is the jurisdictional top-up amount (as determined in accordance with subsection (5)) for all those entities for that financial year;\n\n(b) B is the allocable GloBE income or loss of the entity for that financial year if the entity has a positive amount of allocable GloBE income or loss for that financial year, otherwise B is nil;

where \u2014\n\n(i) A has the meaning given by subsection (3)(a);\n\n(ii) D is nil if the allocable GloBE income or loss of the entity for that financial year is a positive amount or the adjusted covered taxes for that entity for that financial year is nil or a positive amount, otherwise D is the amount determined by multiplying the allocable GloBE income or loss (being nil or a negative amount) of that entity for that financial year by 15% and then deducting the adjusted covered taxes (being a negative amount) for that entity for that financial year, except that if the resulting amount is negative, D is nil; and\n\n(iii) E is the sum of D for each of those entities;\n\n(b) if the jurisdiction has an additional current top-up amount under section 21(4) (as applied by subsection (13)) but not under section 21(1) (as applied by subsection (13)) and the recalculation in section 21(4) is only made for one previous financial year: A \u00d7 F \u00f7 G;

        "summary": "**Summary of the Multinational Enterprise (Minimum Tax) Bill**\n\nThe **Multinational Enterprise (Minimum Tax) Bill** was introduced in Singapore on September 9, 2024, to implement the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar 2) and establish a domestic minimum top-up tax (MTT) for multinational enterprises (MNEs). The key provisions of the Bill are organized into several parts, detailing the framework for the MTT and related domestic top-up tax (DTT).\n\n### Key Provisions:\n\n1. **Short Title and Commencement**:\n   - The Act is titled the **Multinational Enterprise (Minimum Tax) Act 2024** and will come into effect on a date specified by the Minister.\n\n2. **Definitions**:\n   - The Bill defines terms such as **MNE group**, **chargeable entity**, **permanent establishment**, and **flow-through entity**. Notably, the minimum tax rate is set at **15%**.\n\n3. **Application of the Act**:\n   - The Act applies to MNE groups with consolidated group revenue exceeding **EUR 750 million** for at least two out of the last four financial years, starting from January 1, 2025.\n\n4. **Multinational Enterprise Top-Up Tax (MTT)**:\n   - MTT is imposed on chargeable entities if their effective tax rate is below the minimum rate. The MTT is calculated based on the top-up amounts of relevant entities within the MNE group.\n\n5. **Domestic Top-Up Tax (DTT)**:\n   - DTT is payable by MNE groups and is calculated similarly to MTT, ensuring that the overall tax paid by the group meets the minimum effective tax rate.\n\n6. **Registration and Compliance**:\n   - MNE groups must register with the Comptroller of Income Tax, designate local filing entities, and comply with record-keeping requirements. Failure to register may incur penalties.\n\n7. **Returns and Payments**:\n   - Entities are required to file GloBE information returns and pay MTT and DTT as stipulated in the Act. The Comptroller has the authority to gather information and enforce compliance.\n\n8. **Assessments and Appeals**:\n   - The Act outlines procedures for tax assessments, objections, and appeals to ensure entities can contest tax decisions.\n\n9. **Offences and Penalties**:\n   - The Act establishes penalties for non-compliance, including failure to file returns, maintain records, or provide false information.\n\n10. **Miscellaneous Provisions**:\n    - Includes regulations for the application of the Act, the liability of managers, and provisions for the collection and recovery of taxes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **Multinational Enterprise (Minimum Tax) Act 2024** aims to align Singapore's tax framework with international standards to combat tax base erosion and ensure that multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax. The legislation emphasizes compliance, registration, and reporting requirements for MNEs operating in Singapore.",

This is achieved by treating all taxable supplies made by public agencies as supplies made in the course or furtherance of a business. However, the Minister charged with the responsibility for finance may, by order in the Gazette, disapply the Act to a prescribed taxable supply made by a public agency.\n\nClause 3 makes consequential amendments to various provisions in the Act in light of the amendments to section 28 by clause 2.\n\nClause 4 provides for a validation of amounts purportedly imposed as goods and services tax by a public agency on certain supplies.\n\nThe Schedule sets out the supplies in respect of which the validation under clause 4 does not apply.\n\nAs there is no requirement for a notification to be made to bring the provisions in the Bill into force, once the Bill is passed and assented, the provisions come into force upon the publication of the Act in the Gazette.",

Section 25(2) of the principal Act is amended \u2014\n\n(a) by inserting the word \u201cand\u201d at the end of paragraph (f); and\n\n(b) by deleting paragraph (g).\n\nNew section 45A\n\n6.

Section 46(1) of the principal Act is amended by deleting the word \u201cand\u201d at the end of paragraph (f), and by inserting immediately thereafter the following paragraph:\n\n\u201c(fa) where applicable, records of the reasonable steps taken by the taxable person to determine whether or not the supply made to the taxable person was a part of an arrangement mentioned in section 20(2A);\u201d.\n\nAmendment of section 47\n\n8.

Section 90 of the principal Act is amended \u2014\n\n(a) by deleting subsection (1);\n\n(b) by inserting, immediately after subsection (1A), the following subsections:\n\n\u201c(1AA) Subject to subsections (1AB) and (1C), where any person makes a claim in accordance with subsection (1B) that any money was overpaid or erroneously paid by the person as tax chargeable on the importation of goods under this Act (whether such goods were imported by the person or by another person), it is lawful for the Comptroller to refund such money to the person if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Comptroller that the money was overpaid or erroneously paid by the person as tax chargeable on the importation of those goods.\n\n(1AB) Despite subsection (1AA) and subject to subsections (1AC) and (1C), where \u2014\n\n(a) it is proved to the satisfaction of the Comptroller that \u2014\n\n(i) any person (X) has overpaid or erroneously paid any money as tax chargeable on the importation of goods under this Act; and\n\n(ii) the person making the claim to the Comptroller is a taxable person (Y) who has reimbursed X or otherwise provided X with funds for the whole or any part of that money paid by X; and\n\n(b) X has not received from the Comptroller the amount claimed by Y,\n\nthen, it is lawful for the Comptroller to refund or pay to Y the money overpaid or erroneously paid.\n\n(1AC) Nothing in subsection (1AB) entitles Y to any refund in excess of the reimbursement or funds provided by Y for the purpose of X\u2019s payment as tax chargeable on the importation of goods, less the correct amount of the tax.\n\n(1AD) To avoid doubt, nothing in subsection (1AB) prevents X from claiming under subsection (1AA) any part of the overpayment or erroneous payment not claimed by Y under subsection (1AB).\u201d;\n\n(c) by inserting, immediately after subsection (1A), the words \u201c, (1AA) or (1AB)\u201d;\n\n(d) by deleting the word \u201cand\u201d at the end of subsection (1B)(b)(i);\n\n(e) by deleting the full-stop at the end of sub-paragraph (ii) of subsection (1B)(b) and substituting a semi-colon, and by inserting immediately thereafter the following sub-paragraphs:\n\n\u201c(iii) in the case of a claim referred to in subsection (1AA), the date on which the tax chargeable on the importation of the goods concerned was paid by the claimant; and\n\n(iv) in the case of a claim referred to in subsection (1AB), the date on which the tax chargeable on the importation of the goods concerned was paid by X.\u201d; and\n\n(f) by inserting, immediately after subsection (1C), the words \u201c, (1AA) or (1AB)\u201d.\n\nAmendment of First Schedule\n\n20.

Refiners referred to in paragraph 2(a)(iii)(B) of Part III of the Fourth Schedule.\u201d.\n\nNew Ninth Schedule\n\n22. The principal Act is amended by inserting, immediately after the Eighth Schedule, the following Schedule:\n\n\u201cNINTH SCHEDULE\n\nSection 20(2C)\n\nILLUSTRATIONS OF ARRANGEMENTS FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 20(2A)\n\nIllustration 1 \u2014 Missing trader in supply chain\n\nPersons A, B and C are registered under this Act. Person A supplies goods to Person B at a price that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person B supplies the same goods to Person C at a higher price (to earn a profit margin for Person B) that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person C exports the goods to an overseas Person D at a price that does not include tax chargeable on the supply to Person D (on the basis that an export of goods would be a zero-rated supply).\n\nPerson C claims a refund for the input tax paid to Person B and Person B accounts for the output tax on Person B\u2019s supply to Person C (less the input tax paid to Person A). Person A fails to account for the output tax on Person A\u2019s supply to Person B and becomes untraceable.\n\nThe arrangement causes loss of public revenue as a refund is made to Person C while Person A does not account for the output tax due from Person A.\n\nThis illustration applies equally to a supply of services, and if there are 2 or more intermediaries in the supply chain between Person A and Person C.\n\nIllustration 2 \u2014 Obstruction and obfuscation by intermediary\n\nPersons A, B and C are registered under this Act. Person A supplies goods to Person B at a price that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person B supplies the same goods to Person C at a higher price (to earn a profit margin for Person B) that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person C exports the goods to an overseas Person D at a price that does not include tax chargeable on the supply to Person D (on the basis that an export of goods would be a zero-rated supply).\n\nPerson C claims a refund for the input tax paid to Person B and Person B accounts for the output tax on Person B\u2019s supply to Person C (less the input tax paid to Person A). Person A fails to account for the output tax on Person A\u2019s supply to Person B, and Person B obfuscates the identity of Person A (for instance, by Person B becoming untraceable or keeping poor records).\n\nThe arrangement causes loss of public revenue as a refund is made to Person C while Person A does not account for the output tax due from Person A.\n\nThis illustration applies equally to a supply of services, and if there are 2 or more intermediaries in the supply chain between Person A and Person C.\n\nIllustration 3 \u2014 Inflation of value of supply\n\nPersons A, B and C are registered under this Act. Person A supplies goods to Person B at a price that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person B supplies the same goods to Person C at a higher price (to earn a profit margin for Person B) that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person C exports the goods to an overseas Person D at a price that does not include tax chargeable on the supply to Person D (on the basis that an export of goods would be a zero-rated supply).\n\nThe price charged by Person A to Person B for the goods is grossly excessive because the goods are counterfeit, of a poorer quality than described in the supply, or of a lower quantity than described in the supply.\n\nPerson C claims a refund for the input tax paid to Person B and Person B accounts for the output tax on Person B\u2019s supply to Person C (less the input tax paid to Person A). Given the inflated value of the goods, the refund is larger than what would otherwise be given. Person A fails to account for the output tax on Person A\u2019s supply to Person B, and it is not possible to recover the output tax from Person A (for instance, because Person A has little assets).\n\nThe arrangement causes loss of public revenue as, firstly, the refund to Person C is excessive, and, secondly, a refund is made to Person C while Person A does not account for the output tax due from Person A.\n\nThis illustration applies equally to a supply of services, and if there are 2 or more intermediaries in the supply chain between Person A and Person C.\n\nIllustration 4 \u2014 Offsetting input tax against tax on supplies made in another supply chain\n\nPersons A, B and C are registered under this Act. Person A supplies goods to Person B at a price that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person B supplies the same goods to Person C at a higher price (to earn a profit margin for Person B) that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person C exports the goods to an overseas Person D at a price that does not include tax chargeable on the supply to Person D (on the basis that an export of goods would be a zero-rated supply).\n\nPerson C sets off the input tax paid to Person B against the output tax charged on other supplies made to Person E (who is registered under this Act) to reduce the amount of the output tax otherwise payable by Person C to the Comptroller.\n\nPerson B accounts for the output tax on Person B\u2019s supply to Person C (less the input tax paid to Person A). Person A fails to account for the output tax on Person A\u2019s supply to Person B and it is not possible to recover the output tax from Person A.\n\nThe arrangement causes loss of public revenue as Person C has reduced tax otherwise payable by Person C to the Comptroller when Person C sets off the input tax paid to Person B against the output tax charged on other supplies made to Person E, while Person A does not account for the output tax due from Person A.\n\nThis illustration applies equally to a supply of services, and if there are 2 or more intermediaries in the supply chain between Person A and Person C.\n\nIllustration 5 \u2014 Assumption of identity of trader\n\nPerson A is not registered under this Act. Persons B, C and D are registered under this Act. Person A supplies goods to Person B using Person D\u2019s registration details, at a price that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person B supplies the same goods to Person C at a higher price (to earn a profit margin for Person B) that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person C exports the goods to an overseas Person E at a price that does not include tax chargeable on the supply to Person E (on the basis that an export of goods would be a zero-rated supply).\n\nPerson C claims a refund for the input tax paid to Person B and Person B accounts for the output tax on Person B\u2019s supply to Person C (less the input tax paid to Person A).\n\nThe arrangement causes loss of public revenue as a refund is made to Person C while Person D does not account for any output tax to the Comptroller since Person D did not actually make the supply of goods to Person B.\n\nThis illustration applies equally to a supply of services, and if there are 2 or more intermediaries in the supply chain between Person A and Person C.\u201d.\n\nMiscellaneous amendments\n\n23. The principal Act is amended \u2014\n\n(a) by deleting the word \u201cfrom\u201d in the following provisions and substituting in each case the word \u201cafter\u201d:\n\nSections 19(15) (definition of \u201cinitial specified period\u201d and paragraphs (a)(ii) and (b)(ii) of the definition of \u201csubsequent specified period\u201d), 25(2)(b), 45(5)(a) and (b) and (10B), 46(2)(a) and (b), 51(1)(a) and 90(1B)(b);\n\n(b) by deleting the word \u201cfrom\u201d in section 30(3) and substituting the words \u201cwith effect from\u201d;\n\n(c) by deleting subsection (4) of section 32 and substituting the following subsection:\n\n\u201c(4) Where a taxable person dies, or goes into liquidation or receivership, or becomes bankrupt or incapacitated, the Comptroller may, for the period \u2014\n\n(a) beginning on the date of the death, receivership, bankruptcy or incapacity; and\n\n(b) ending on the date immediately before \u2014\n\n(i) the date another person is registered in respect of the taxable supplies made or intended to be made by that taxable person in the course or furtherance of that taxable person\u2019s business; or\n\n(ii) in the case of incapacity, the date the incapacity ceases,\n\ndeem any person carrying on that business to be a taxable person.\u201d;\n\n(d) by deleting the words \u201cdays of\u201d in the following provisions and substituting in each case the words \u201cdays after\u201d:\n\nSections 32(6), 49(2), 51(1)(b) and (3), 60(1)(b) and 79(4)(a)(i) and (ii), (c) and (d)(ii) and paragraphs 11 and 15(2)(a) and (b) and (3) of the First Schedule;\n\n(e) by deleting the words \u201ccommencing from the expiry of the period prescribed\u201d in section 60(2)(b) and substituting the words \u201ccommencing on the day immediately after the last day of the period prescribed\u201d;\n\n(f) by deleting the words \u201ccommencing from\u201d in section 61(i) and substituting the words \u201cbeginning on\u201d;\n\n(g) by deleting the words \u201cat the place\u201d in section 89(2B) and substituting the words \u201cin the manner\u201d;\n\n(h) by deleting sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 4 of the First Schedule and substituting the following sub-paragraph:\n\n\u201c(2) The Comptroller must register any such person (whether or not the person so notifies the Comptroller) with effect from \u2014\n\n(a) the day immediately after the end of the month that follows the month in which the 30th day falls; or\n\n(b) such earlier date as may be agreed between the Comptroller and the person.\u201d;\n\n(i) by deleting the words \u201c30 days of the beginning of that period\u201d in paragraph 5(1) of the First Schedule and substituting the words \u201c30 days after the first day of that period\u201d;\n\n(j) by deleting sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 5 of the First Schedule and substituting the following sub-paragraph:\n\n\u201c(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3), the Comptroller must register any such person (whether or not the person so notifies the Comptroller) with effect from \u2014\n\n(a) the day immediately after the end of the 30 days; or\n\n(b) such earlier date as may be agreed between the Comptroller and the person.\u201d;\n\n(k) by deleting the words \u201c30 days of the time when\u201d in paragraph 6(1) of the First Schedule and substituting the words \u201c30 days after the day on which\u201d;\n\n(l) by deleting the words \u201ctime when\u201d in paragraph 6(2) of the First Schedule and substituting the words \u201cday on which\u201d;\n\n(m) by deleting the word \u201cfrom\u201d in paragraph 6(b) of Part I of the Fifth Schedule and substituting the words \u201cbeginning on\u201d; and\n\n(n) by deleting the word \u201cfrom\u201d in paragraphs 13(2) and 15 of Part I of the Fifth Schedule and substituting in each case the words \u201cwith effect from\u201d.\n\nValidation\n\n24.\u2014(1) This section applies where the Comptroller has, during the period from 18 February 2020 to the date of commencement of section 3 of the Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Act 2020 (called in this section the appointed date) (both dates inclusive) \u2014\n\n(a) furnished to \u2014\n\n(i) the chief executive officer of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore established under section 3 of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore Act; or\n\n(ii) an officer duly authorised by the chief executive officer,\n\nany information required for the performance of the official duties of the chief executive officer or authorised officer in administering the public scheme known as the Jobs Support Scheme; or\n\n(b) allowed the chief executive officer or authorised officer such access to any records or documents as may be necessary for the performance of those official duties.\n\n(2) An act mentioned in subsection (1)(a) or (b) is taken to have been validly carried out in accordance with section 6(6C) of the principal Act as in force on the appointed date, as if that provision were in force at the material time.\n\nSaving\n\n25.

Illustrations (non-exhaustive) of missing trader fraud are set out in the Ninth Schedule (inserted by clause 22). The new subsections (2D) and (2E) provide for who is regarded as a person who \u201cshould have known\u201d of this.\n\nClause 5 makes a consequential amendment to section 25 (Refund or remission of tax in certain cases). Paragraph (g) of section 25(2) is no longer necessary in light of the amendments to section 83A (under clause 14).\n\nClause 6 inserts a new section 45A to provide for the imposition of a surcharge on a taxable person who makes a claim for any credit for input tax in respect of a supply to the taxable person which the taxable person should have known was a part of an arrangement under the new section 20(2A).\n\nClause 7 amends section 46 (Duty to keep records) to require a taxable person to keep records of the reasonable steps taken by the taxable person to ascertain whether or not a supply made to the taxable person is a supply mentioned in the new section 20(2A).\n\nClause 8 amends section 47 (Comptroller may disregard certain transactions and dispositions) \u2014\n\n(a) to require the Comptroller to disregard or vary a tax avoidance arrangement described in the section and to make adjustments in order to counteract any tax advantage obtained or obtainable by the person under that arrangement;\n\n(b) to provide for additional grounds on which the Comptroller must make adjustments;\n\n(c) to provide for a time limit of 5 years after the end of a prescribed accounting period in respect of which the Comptroller may make an adjustment;\n\n(d) to provide that the issue of whether subsection (1) applies to a case, and any action by the Comptroller under subsection (1A) in a case, may be questioned in an appeal against an assessment in accordance with Part VIII;\n\n(e) to require payment of any additional tax arising from any adjustment to be made within one month after the date of service on the person of a written notice of the adjustment; and\n\n(f) to amend the section heading to properly reflect the intent of the section.\n\nClause 9 inserts a new section 47A to provide that if the Comptroller makes any adjustment under section 47, a surcharge equal to 50% of the amount of any additional tax imposed on a person as a result of the adjustment is recoverable from the person as a debt due to the Government.\n\nClause 10 amends section 52 (Hearing and disposal of appeals) to insert a new subsection (3A) to provide that, in an appeal to the Goods and Services Tax Board of Review in connection with the applicability of the new section 20(2A) to a claim for any credit for input tax on a supply made to a taxable person, the onus is on the Comptroller to show on a balance of probabilities that the supply was a part of an arrangement mentioned in that provision, and that the taxable person knew or should have known of the same.\n\nClause 11 amends section 59 (Penalty for incorrect return) to insert a new subsection (3) to exclude from the section a claim for credit for input tax on a supply which a taxable person should have known was a part of an arrangement mentioned in the new section 20(2A). This is because the taxable person is already liable to a surcharge under the new section 45A (inserted by clause 6).\n\nClause 12 makes consequential amendments to section 60 (Penalty for failure to pay or make returns within prescribed period) arising from the amendments to section 47 (under clause 8) and the new section 47A (inserted by clause 9). The clause amends subsection (1) so as to apply to the additional tax mentioned in section 47(1B). The clause also inserts a new subsection (1B) to impose the late payment penalty on surcharges and interest payable under the new sections 45A and 47A.\n\nClause 13 deletes and substitutes subsection (7) of section 82 (Recovery of tax from persons leaving Singapore) so as to apply the section to surcharges and interest payable under sections 45A, 47 and 47A.\n\nClauses 14 and 15 amend sections 83A (Seizure of goods) and 83B (Goods liable to seizure liable to forfeiture), respectively, to expand and clarify the circumstances in which goods may be seized, and to include safeguards for the goods so seized, similar to the safeguards in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68). Currently, seizure of goods under section 83A is only applicable in the context of sections 21(8) and 25(2)(g).\n\nClause 16 repeals section 83C (Goods seized in respect of which there is no prosecution, deemed to be forfeited if not claimed within one month) as the section is no longer necessary in light of the amendments to sections 83A and 83B under clauses 14 and 15, respectively.\n\nClause 17 makes a consequential amendment to subsection (1)(b) of section 83E (Arrest of persons) in light of the deletion of section 25(2)(g) (under clause 5).\n\nClause 18 amends section 86 (Orders and regulations) to empower the Minister to make regulations to provide for the mode of payment for refunds under the Act.\n\nClause 19 amends section 90 (Return of tax or penalty overpaid or erroneously paid) by deleting subsection (1) (which requires certain claims to be made within 6 years) such that all claims made under the section must be made to the Comptroller within 5 years (as provided in subsection (1B)). The clause also inserts new subsections (1AA) to (1AD) to make express provision for the refund of any money overpaid or erroneously paid as tax chargeable on the importation of goods under the Act, and to provide, in circumstances where a person who paid that tax was reimbursed by a taxable person for the payment, which person is entitled to, and the extent of, the refund.\n\nClause 20 amends the First Schedule (Registration) to empower the Comptroller to impose conditions on the compulsory registration of a person as a taxable person, to make technical amendments to the power to impose conditions on the voluntary registration of a person as a taxable person, and to clarify that new conditions may be imposed at any time (and not just at the point of registration).\n\nClause 21 repeals and re-enacts the Sixth Schedule to allow for public schemes to be specified for the purposes of the new section 6(6C).\n\nClause 22 inserts a new Ninth Schedule to provide for illustrations (non-exhaustive) of the arrangements to which the new section 20(2A) applies.\n\nClause 23 makes the following miscellaneous amendments to the Act:\n\n(a) clause 23(a) to (f) and (h) to (n) amends various provisions in the Act to clarify when a period of time is to be calculated from, in particular, whether the time period includes or excludes a particular day;\n\n(b) clause 23(g) amends section 89(2B) to accommodate the different types of payment methods available.\n\nClause 24 validates the Comptroller\u2019s provision of and grant of access to any information to the chief executive officer of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore or an officer duly authorised by the chief executive officer, that is required for the performance of the official duties of the chief executive officer or authorised officer in administering the Jobs Support Scheme. Such an act is considered to be validly carried out as if the new section 6(6C) were in force at the material time.\n\nClause 25 makes a saving provision in respect of the amendments under clause 15. \n\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

(5B) Nothing in subsection (5A) prevents the monitoring plan (as on the day immediately before the date of the transfer of operational control) from continuing to be a monitoring plan for the business facility as a taxable facility of X for the purpose of X complying with any of X\u2019s obligations under this section and sections 12, 14 and 15. (6) Any approval or deemed approval under this section for a monitoring plan for a taxable facility of a registered person ceases to be valid in relation to that registered person with effect from the deregistration of that taxable facility as such.\u201d.\n\nAmendment of section 16\n\n9.

In section 17 of the principal Act \u2014\n\n(a) in subsection (1), delete \u201ca reporting period\u201d and substitute \u201can emissions year\u201d;\n\n(b) in subsection (1)(a)(i), delete \u201creporting period\u201d and substitute \u201cemissions year\u201d;\n\n(c) in subsection (2), delete paragraph (a) and substitute \u2014 \u201c(a) subject to subsection (3A), by the surrender of fixed-price carbon credits; or\u201d;\n\n(d) in subsection (2)(b), delete \u201cregistry account\u201d and substitute \u201cFPCC registry account\u201d; and\n\n(e) delete subsection (3) and substitute \u2014 \u201c(3) Subject to subsection (3A), the number of fixed-price carbon credits that must be surrendered under subsection (2)(a) is the number assessed by the Agency to have a total carbon price equal to the amount of tax charged. (3A) Despite subsections (2)(a) and (3) and subject to section 33B, one eligible international carbon credit may be surrendered in place of one fixed-price carbon credit, in respect of such tax for such emissions year as may be prescribed. (3B) Where any tax is required to be paid pursuant to a revision of an assessment under section 23 \u2014 (a) the number of fixed-price carbon credits (at the carbon price applicable to the year in which they are to be purchased for the payment) that must be surrendered under subsection (2)(a) is the number assessed by the Agency to have a total carbon price equal to the amount of the tax, rounded down to the nearest whole number of such fixed-price carbon credits; and (b) subsection (3A) does not apply except in the circumstances and to the extent prescribed.\u201d.\n\nAmendment of section 19\n\n11. In section 19 of the principal Act \u2014\n\n(a) in subsection (1)(a), delete \u201ccarbon credits\u201d and substitute \u201cfixed-price carbon credits, or both fixed-price carbon credits and eligible international carbon credits,\u201d;\n\n(b) in subsection (2)(a), delete \u201ca registry account\u201d and substitute \u201can FPCC registry account\u201d;\n\n(c) in subsection (2), delete \u201cthe registry account\u201d and substitute \u201cthe FPCC registry account\u201d;\n\n(d) in subsection (2), delete \u201ccarbon credits\u201d and substitute \u201cfixed-price carbon credits\u201d;\n\n(e) after subsection (2), insert \u2014 \u201c(2A) To avoid doubt, the fixed-price carbon credits refunded under subsection (2) must be at the carbon price applicable for the purchase of fixed-price carbon credits in the year in which the refund is made.

(2) In this Division, a person is from the public sector if the person is a public officer or an employee of a public body.\n\nApplication of this Division\n\n20B. This Division applies in relation to any emissions year in the period from and including 1 January 2024 up to and including such date as the Minister may prescribe under section 20F.\n\nReduction of reckonable GHG emissions chargeable to tax\n\n20C. Despite section 16(3), where a taxable facility is eligible for any allowance for any emissions year, the amount of the tax chargeable under section 16(1) for that emissions year is calculated based on the formula (A \u2013 C) \u00d7 B, where \u2014 (a) A and B have the meanings given by section 16(3)(a) and (b), respectively; (b) C is the allowance for the taxable facility for the emissions year; and (c) (A \u2013 C) is rounded up to the nearest metric tonne.\n\nTaxable facilities eligible for allowances\n\n20D.\u2014(1) A taxable facility of a registered person is eligible for allowances if \u2014 (a) the registered person is in the business of making exports or making supplies to another person who is in the business of making exports, and the taxable facility is used in connection with that business of the registered person; and (b) the Minister determines that that business of the registered person is of sufficient economic or strategic importance to the growth, expansion, development or wellbeing of the Singapore economy, to justify an award of allowances for the taxable facility. (2) The Minister must notify the registered person of a taxable facility that is eligible for allowances of that fact, and grant the registered person an award of allowances for the taxable facility.\n\nAwards of allowances\n\n20E.\u2014(1) The Minister must, in an award of allowances for any taxable facility, specify \u2014 (a) the emissions years in respect of which the taxable facility is entitled to allowances; and (b) the methodology by which the amount of allowance for each such emissions year is to be calculated. (2) In devising the methodology for any emissions year, the Minister may \u2014 (a) adopt or take into consideration any combination (including any part thereof): (i) the whole or any part of relevant GHG emissions or intensity, or energy use or efficiency, to any internationally-recognised benchmark; (ii) any other matter that the Minister considers appropriate for the purpose of incentivising the continued reduction in the GHG emissions of the taxable facility; and (b) provide for a maximum amount of allowance for any emissions year, determined \u2014 (i) by prescribing that the tax chargeable for an emissions year (calculated based on the formula (A \u2013 C) \u00d7 B in section 20C) must not, when divided by A for that emissions year, result in an amount that is less than the amount specified by the Minister in the award for this purpose; or (ii) in any other manner that the Minister considers appropriate to incentivise continued reduction in GHG emissions of the taxable facility. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the Minister may devise different methodologies for \u2014 (a) different taxable facilities; (b) different classes of taxable facilities; (c) different emissions years (including with respect to the same taxable facility); or (d) different circumstances. (4) The Minister may at any time, in respect of any emissions year for which a taxable facility is entitled to an allowance under an award of allowances, amend the award of allowances by \u2014 (a) modifying the methodology specified for the emissions year; or (b) substituting some other methodology for the emissions year, in any circumstances that the Minister thinks appropriate, including where the original methodology ceases to be internationally-recognised, or ceases to be valid or applicable, or ceases to have or is reduced in its relevance, in relation to the registered person or the business for which the taxable facility is used. (5) The modified or substituted methodology must not be applied in respect of any emissions year for which the Agency has made an assessment of tax under Division 2 of Part 5, but may be so applied if the assessment is being revised under section 23. (6) The Minister must, in respect of each emissions year mentioned in subsection (1)(a), determine the amount of the allowance for that emissions year in accordance with the methodology mentioned in subsection (1)(b).\n\nRegulations\n\n20F. The Minister may make regulations for any matter that is necessary, required or permitted to be prescribed to give effect to this Division, and the regulations may make different provisions for \u2014 (a) different persons or business facilities; (b) different classes of persons or business facilities; (c) different emissions years (including with respect to the same taxable facility); or (d) different circumstances.\n\nAssignment of function or power to public body\n\n20G.\u2014(1) The Minister may assign any of his or her functions and powers under this Division to any public body. (2) Where the public body is not one for which the Minister is the responsible Minister, the Minister must consult the responsible Minister for the public body on the assignment. (3) An assignment under this section \u2014 (a) must be made by order in the Gazette; (b) may be general or limited; (c) may be subject to conditions that are consistent with the nature of the assigned function or power; (d) may be to 2 or more public bodies at the same time; and (e) does not prevent the Minister from carrying out or exercising the assigned function or power.

(5) A member of the public body who is not from the public sector must not be involved in the carrying out of a function or the exercise of a power assigned to the public body. (6) The public body must not delegate a function or power assigned to it, to any of its members, or to any other person, who is not from the public sector. (7) Without affecting any obligation as to secrecy or other restriction against the disclosure of information imposed by any law or contract \u2014 (a) a member of the public body who is from the public sector; or (b) a person who has been delegated a function or power assigned to the public body, that receives or obtains any information for the purposes of this Division, must not disclose or provide access to such information to a member of the public body, or any other person, who is not from the public sector. (8) Subsection (7) does not apply to the following information: (a) information the disclosure of which has been approved by the Minister; (b) information relating to a person \u2014 (i) for which consent for disclosure has been obtained from the person; or (ii) that is already in the possession of the public body; (c) information that is publicly available. (9) The public body may carry out a function or exercise a power assigned to it despite the absence of a quorum at any meeting of the public body because of subsection (5) or (7), and the absence of a quorum does not affect the validity of anything done by the public body at the meeting. (10) This section does not permit the assignment of \u2014 (a) any power to make subsidiary legislation; and (b) the power of assignment in this section.\u201d.\n\nAmendment of section 21\n\n14.

        "summary": "The **Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Act 2022** amends the **Carbon Pricing Act 2018** in Singapore, with significant changes aimed at enhancing carbon pricing mechanisms and compliance requirements. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Terminology Changes**:\n   - \"Carbon credits\" are redefined as \"fixed-price carbon credits.\"\n   - Introduction of \"eligible international carbon credits\" which can be surrendered in place of fixed-price carbon credits for tax purposes.\n\n2. **Carbon Tax Rates**:\n   - The carbon tax rate is revised to $5 per tonne of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) for emissions in 2023, $25 for 2024-2025, and $45 for 2026 and beyond.\n\n3. **Allowances**:\n   - The Act introduces allowances that can reduce the taxable emissions of a facility. These are available to facilities deemed economically or strategically important for Singapore's growth.\n   - The Minister will determine the methodology for calculating these allowances.\n\n4. **Surrender of Credits**:\n   - Registered persons can surrender eligible international carbon credits to offset their carbon tax liabilities, subject to prescribed limits.\n   - The Act establishes an **International Carbon Credits Registry** for managing these credits.\n\n5. **Registration and Reporting**:\n   - Changes to registration requirements for facilities, especially when operational control is transferred.\n   - Emissions reporting obligations are clarified, including the need for verified emissions reports.\n\n6. **Deregistration Provisions**:\n   - The Agency can deregister facilities that have ceased operations or if the registered person has been dissolved.\n\n7. **Waiver of Small Assessments**:\n   - The Agency may waive tax assessments for amounts below a certain threshold, set at five times the carbon price applicable for fixed-price carbon credits.\n\n8. **Transitional Provisions**:\n   - Existing carbon credit accounts will be treated as fixed-price carbon credit accounts, and previous carbon credits will be converted accordingly.\n\n9. **Enforcement and Penalties**:\n   - Stricter penalties for inaccurate emissions reporting, including fines and potential imprisonment.\n\nThis amendment aims to strengthen Singapore's carbon pricing framework, promote sustainability, and enhance compliance among businesses regarding greenhouse gas emissions.",

        "summary": "**Summary of the Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Act 2022**\n\nThe Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Act 2022 was passed by the Singapore Parliament on November 7, 2022, and received presidential assent on November 24, 2022. The Act amends the Goods and Services Tax Act 1993 and introduces several key changes relevant to tax administration in Singapore.\n\n### Key Provisions:\n\n1. **Commencement**: \n   - Certain sections of the Act are effective from January 1, 2022, while others will commence on a date to be appointed by the Minister.\n\n2. **Reverse Charge Supply**:\n   - New provisions in Section 11C clarify the timing of reverse charge supplies related to distantly taxable goods or services. If a recipient pays tax on such a supply and is later reimbursed, the reverse charge supply is deemed to occur at the earlier of the date of a revised invoice or the reimbursement date.\n\n3. **Tax Rate Changes**:\n   - The tax rate will increase from 7% to 8% for the period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, and further to 9% from January 1, 2024.\n\n4. **Supplies Spanning Tax Changes**:\n   - New provisions outline how to handle supplies that span changes in tax rates. Tax can be charged at either the old or new rate depending on the timing of the supply and the consideration received.\n\n5. **Penalties for Fraudulent Arrangements**:\n   - A new section introduces penalties for individuals participating in arrangements intended to cause loss of public revenue, with fines up to $500,000 or imprisonment for up to 10 years.\n\n6. **Transitional Provisions**:\n   - For supplies made between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, the value of supplies will be determined as if the new provisions had not yet come into effect.\n\n7. **Miscellaneous Amendments**:\n   - Various technical amendments were made to clarify definitions, adjust the treatment of certain supplies, and ensure compliance with the updated tax framework.\n\n### Implications:\nBusinesses and tax practitioners must be aware of the new tax rates and the implications of the amendments on their supply chains, invoicing practices, and compliance requirements. The changes aim to streamline tax administration and enhance clarity regarding tax obligations in light of evolving economic conditions.\n\nOverall, the Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Act 2022 represents a significant update to Singapore's GST framework, particularly in the context of international trade and digital services.",

In section 17 of the principal Act \u2014\n\n(a) in subsection (1), delete \u201ca reporting period\u201d and substitute \u201can emissions year\u201d;\n\n(b) in subsection (1)(a)(i), delete \u201creporting period\u201d and substitute \u201cemissions year\u201d;\n\n(c) in subsection (2), delete paragraph (a) and substitute \u2014 \u201c(a) subject to subsection (3A), by the surrender of fixed-price carbon credits; or\u201d;\n\n(d) in subsection (2)(b), delete \u201cregistry account\u201d and substitute \u201cFPCC registry account\u201d; and\n\n(e) delete subsection (3) and substitute \u2014 \u201c(3) Subject to subsection (3A), the number of fixed-price carbon credits that must be surrendered under subsection (2)(a) is the number assessed by the Agency to have a total carbon price equal to the amount of tax charged. (3A) Despite subsections (2)(a) and (3) and subject to section 33B, one eligible international carbon credit may be surrendered in place of one fixed-price carbon credit, in respect of such tax for such emissions year as may be prescribed. (3B) Where any tax is required to be paid pursuant to a revision of an assessment under section 23 \u2014 (a) the number of fixed-price carbon credits (at the carbon price applicable to the year in which they are to be purchased for the payment) that must be surrendered under subsection (2)(a) is the number assessed by the Agency to have a total carbon price equal to the amount of the tax, rounded down to the nearest whole number of such fixed-price carbon credits; and (b) subsection (3A) does not apply except in the circumstances and to the extent prescribed.\u201d.\n\nAmendment of section 19\n\n11. In section 19 of the principal Act \u2014\n\n(a) in subsection (1)(a), delete \u201ccarbon credits\u201d and substitute \u201cfixed-price carbon credits, or both fixed-price carbon credits and eligible international carbon credits,\u201d;\n\n(b) in subsection (2)(a), delete \u201ca registry account\u201d and substitute \u201can FPCC registry account\u201d;\n\n(c) in subsection (2), delete \u201cthe registry account\u201d and substitute \u201cthe FPCC registry account\u201d;\n\n(d) in subsection (2), delete \u201ccarbon credits\u201d and substitute \u201cfixed-price carbon credits\u201d;\n\n(e) after subsection (2), insert \u2014 \u201c(2A) To avoid doubt, the fixed-price carbon credits refunded under subsection (2) must be at the carbon price applicable for the purchase of fixed-price carbon credits in the year in which the refund is made.

(2) In this Division, a person is from the public sector if the person is a public officer or an employee of a public body.\n\nApplication of this Division\n\n20B. This Division applies in relation to any emissions year in the period from and including 1 January 2024 up to and including such date as the Minister may prescribe under section 20F.\n\nReduction of reckonable GHG emissions chargeable to tax\n\n20C. Despite section 16(3), where a taxable facility is eligible for any allowance for any emissions year, the amount of the tax chargeable under section 16(1) for that emissions year is calculated based on the formula (A \u2013 C) \u00d7 B, where \u2014 (a) A and B have the meanings given by section 16(3)(a) and (b), respectively; (b) C is the allowance for the taxable facility for the emissions year; and (c) (A \u2013 C) is rounded up to the nearest metric tonne.\n\nTaxable facilities eligible for allowances\n\n20D.\u2014(1) A taxable facility of a registered person is eligible for allowances if \u2014 (a) the registered person is in the business of making exports or making supplies to another person who is in the business of making exports, and the taxable facility is used in connection with that business of the registered person; and (b) the Minister determines that that business of the registered person is of sufficient economic or strategic importance to the growth, expansion, development or wellbeing of the Singapore economy, to justify an award of allowances for the taxable facility. (2) The Minister must notify the registered person of a taxable facility that is eligible for allowances of that fact, and grant the registered person an award of allowances for the taxable facility.\n\nAwards of allowances\n\n20E.\u2014(1) The Minister must, in an award of allowances for any taxable facility, specify \u2014 (a) the emissions years in respect of which the taxable facility is entitled to allowances; and (b) the methodology by which the amount of allowance for each such emissions year is to be calculated. (2) In devising the methodology for any emissions year, the Minister may \u2014 (a) adopt or take into consideration any or any combination of the following (including any part thereof): (i) the whole or any part of GHG emissions or intensity, or energy use or efficiency, to any internationally-recognised benchmark; (ii) any other matter that the Minister considers appropriate for the purpose of incentivising the continued reduction in the GHG emissions of the taxable facility; and (b) provide for a maximum amount of allowance for any emissions year, determined \u2014 (i) by prescribing that the tax chargeable for an emissions year (calculated based on the formula (A \u2013 C) \u00d7 B in section 20C) must not, when divided by A for that emissions year, result in an amount that is less than the amount specified by the Minister in the award for this purpose; or (ii) in any other manner that the Minister considers appropriate to incentivise the continued reduction in GHG emissions of the taxable facility. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the Minister may devise different methodologies for \u2014 (a) different taxable facilities; (b) different classes of taxable facilities; (c) different emissions years (including with respect to the same taxable facility); or (d) different circumstances. (4) The Minister may at any time, in respect of any emissions year for which a taxable facility is entitled to an allowance under an award of allowances, amend the award of allowances by \u2014 (a) modifying the methodology specified for the emissions year; or (b) substituting some other methodology for the emissions year, as the Minister thinks appropriate, in any circumstances that include where the original methodology ceases to be internationally-recognised, or ceases to be valid or applicable, or ceases to have or is reduced in its relevance, in relation to the registered person or the business for which the taxable facility is used. (5) The modified or substituted methodology must not be applied in respect of any emissions year for which the Agency has made an assessment of tax under Division 2 of Part 5, but may be so applied if the assessment is being revised under section 23. (6) The Minister must, in respect of each emissions year mentioned in subsection (1)(a), determine the amount of the allowance for that emissions year in accordance with the methodology mentioned in subsection (1)(b) for that emissions year.\n\nRegulations\n\n20F. The Minister may make regulations for any matter that is necessary, required or permitted to be prescribed to give effect to this Division, and the regulations may make different provisions for \u2014 (a) different persons or business facilities; (b) different classes of persons or business facilities; (c) different emissions years (including with respect to the same taxable facility); or (d) different circumstances.\n\nAssignment of function or power to public body\n\n20G.\u2014(1) The Minister may assign any of his or her functions and powers under this Division to any public body. (2) Where the public body is not one for which the Minister is the responsible Minister, the Minister must consult the responsible Minister for the public body on the assignment. (3) An assignment under this section \u2014 (a) must be made by order in the Gazette; (b) may be general or limited; (c) may be subject to conditions that are consistent with the nature of the assigned function or power; (d) may be to 2 or more public bodies at the same time; and (e) does not prevent the Minister from carrying out or exercising the assigned function or power. (4) Upon an assignment being made under this section \u2014 (a) the public body, when carrying out the function or exercising the power assigned to it, is treated as carrying out a function or exercising a power conferred on the public body under the Act that establishes it; and (b) the public body must carry out the function or exercise the power assigned to it in accordance with any directions given by the Minister. (5) A member of the public body who is not from the public sector must not be involved in the carrying out of a function or the exercise of a power assigned to the public body. (6) The public body must not delegate a function or power assigned to it, to any of its members, or to any other person, who is not from the public sector. (7) Without affecting any obligation as to secrecy or other restriction against the disclosure of information imposed by any law or contract \u2014 (a) a member of the public body who is from the public sector; or (b) a person who has been delegated a function or power assigned to the public body, that receives or obtains any information for the purposes of this Division, must not disclose or provide access to such information to a member of the public body, or any other person, who is not from the public sector. (8) Subsection (7) does not apply to the following information: (a) information the disclosure of which has been approved by the Minister; (b) information relating to a person \u2014 (i) for which consent for disclosure has been obtained from the person; or (ii) that is already in the possession of the public body; (c) information that is publicly available. (9) The public body may carry out a function or exercise a power assigned to it despite the absence of a quorum at any meeting of the public body because of subsection (5) or (7), and the absence of a quorum does not affect the validity of anything done by the public body at the meeting. (10) This section does not permit the assignment of \u2014 (a) any power to make subsidiary legislation; and (b) the power of assignment in this section.\u201d.\n\nAmendment of section 21\n\n14.

Clause 2(c), (d) and (e) inserts definitions of \u201celigible international carbon credit\u201d, \u201cfixed-price carbon credit\u201d, \u201cfixed-price carbon credit registry account\u201d or \u201cFPCC registry account\u201d, \u201cinternational carbon credit\u201d, \u201cinternational carbon credit registry account\u201d or \u201cICC registry account\u201d and \u201cMinister\u201d. Clause 2(a), (b) and (f) makes consequential amendments to the definitions of \u201ccarbon credit\u201d and \u201ccarbon price\u201d and deletes the definition of \u201cregistry account\u201d.\n\nClauses 3, 4, 7 and 8 amend sections 7, 8, 11 and 13, respectively, to modify the obligations of a person (Y) to whom a registered person or a person liable to be registered as a registered person (each X) transfers operational control over a business facility, in relation to \u2014 (a) Y\u2019s registration as a registered person, and the registration of the business facility as a reportable facility, or both a reportable facility and a taxable facility, of Y; and (b) X\u2019s and Y\u2019s submission of emissions reports and monitoring plans.\n\nAn example of the modifications to the obligations is as follows, where X transfers operational control over the business facility to Y in 2025:\n\nYear\n\nGHG emissions (tCO2e)\n\nCurrent registration and reporting obligations\n\nRevised registration and reporting obligations\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\nLess than 2,000\n\n25,000 or more\n\n25,000 or more\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nX must apply to be registered as a registered person and for the business facility to be registered as a reportable facility and a taxable facility of X, by 30 June 2024;\n\nX must apply to be registered as a registered person and for the business facility to be registered as a reportable facility and a taxable facility of X, by 30 June 2024;\n\nX must submit a monitoring plan by 31 December 2024\n\nX must submit a monitoring plan by 31 December 2024\n\nGHG emissions (tCO2e)\n\n25,000 or more\n\nYear\n\n2025\n\n(transfer of operational control in the third quarter of 2025)\n\nCurrent registration and reporting obligations\n\nX must submit an emissions report for the GHG emissions of the business facility in 2024, by 30 June 2025;\n\nRevised registration and reporting obligations\n\nX must submit an emissions report for the GHG emissions of the business facility in 2024, by 30 June 2025;\n\nX may apply to deregister the business facility as a reportable facility and a taxable facility of X\n\nX may apply to deregister the business facility as a reportable facility and a taxable facility of X\n\nY must apply to be registered as a registered person and for the business facility to be registered as a reportable facility and a taxable facility of Y, within 30 days after the transfer of operational control;\n\nY is treated as having submitted a monitoring plan, based on X\u2019s approved monitoring plan\n\nYear\n\n2026\n\nGHG emissions (tCO2e)\n\n25,000 or more\n\nCurrent registration and reporting obligations\n\nX must submit a verified emissions report for the GHG emissions of the business facility in 2025 up to the date mentioned in section 11(2)(c), by 30 June 2026;\n\nX may apply to deregister as a registered person\n\nRevised registration and reporting obligations\n\nX must submit a verified emissions report for the GHG emissions of the business facility in 2025 up to the date immediately before the date of the transfer of operational control, by 30 June 2026 (unless the new section 11(2C) applies);\n\nX may apply to deregister as a registered person\n\nY must submit a verified emissions report for the GHG emissions of the business facility from the date of the transfer of operational control up to 31 December 2025, by 30 June 2026 (subject to the new section 11(2C) applying)\n\nYear\n\n2027\n\nGHG emissions (tCO2e)\n\n25,000 or more\n\nRevised registration and reporting obligations\n\nY must submit a verified emissions report for the GHG emissions of the business facility in 2026, by 30 June 2027\n\nCurrent registration and reporting obligations\n\nY must apply to be registered as a registered person and for the business facility to be registered as a reportable facility and a taxable facility of Y, by 30 June 2027;\n\nY must submit a monitoring plan by 31 December 2027\n\n2028\n\n25,000 or more\n\n2029\n\n25,000 or more\n\nY must submit an emissions report for the GHG emissions of the business facility in 2027, by 30 June 2028\n\nY must submit a verified emissions report for the GHG emissions of the business facility in 2027, by 30 June 2028\n\nY must submit a verified emissions report for the GHG emissions of the business facility in 2028, by 30 June 2029\n\nY must submit a verified emissions report for the GHG emissions of the business facility in 2028, by 30 June 2029\n\nTo enable the above changes in obligations of X and Y, whether the threshold or the GHG emissions of the business facility attain the first or second threshold in any year is no longer tied to X or Y (as the case may be) having operational control over the business facility for the whole year, but simply to the GHG emissions in the year. The reporting periods are tied to periods of operational control over the business facility. For the year in which the transfer of operational control takes place, Y may, with the approval of the National Environment Agency (the Agency), add X\u2019s reporting period to its reporting period (new section 11(2C)).\n\nClause 5 amends section 9 to allow the deregistration of a business facility as a reportable facility or a taxable facility if the registered person of the business facility, despite having operational control over the business facility, has ceased to operate the business facility and has no intention of resuming its business activity within the next 36 months after such cessation. Clause 5 further amends section 9 to empower the Agency to deregister any registered person, and any reportable facility or taxable facility of the registered person, if the Agency is satisfied that the registered person has been wound up or dissolved or has otherwise ceased to exist.\n\nClause 6 amends section 10(4) to clarify that section 10(4) does not apply where the Agency deregisters a registered person on its own volition under section 9(5) (as inserted by clause 5).\n\nClause 9 amends section 16 to alter the basis on which the carbon tax is chargeable, taking into consideration the changes to the registration and emissions reporting requirements made by clauses 3, 4, 7 and 8. Where X transfers operational control over a business facility to Y in any year, the carbon tax is to be calculated based on the total amount of reckonable GHG emissions of the business facility for the whole of that year (emissions year) as set out in the verified emissions reports of X and Y (or of Y if the new section 11(2C) applies). Y is liable for the whole of the carbon tax for the emissions year (whether the verified emissions reports are submitted by X and Y for their respective reporting periods in the emissions year, or only by Y pursuant to the new section 11(2C)).\n\nClause 10 amends section 17 to provide, in connection with the payment of the carbon tax, for the surrender of eligible international carbon credits in place of fixed-price carbon credits. Clause 10 also makes various consequential amendments to section 17.\n\nClause 11(e) amends section 19 to provide for various matters concerning the making of refunds of the carbon tax paid, in particular where the carbon price of fixed-price carbon credits in the year of the payment of the carbon tax differs from the carbon price of fixed-price carbon credits in the year of the refund. Clause 11 also makes various consequential amendments to section 19.\n\nClause 12 makes a consequential amendment to section 20(1)(d).\n\nClause 13 inserts a new Division 1A of Part 5 to provide for the granting of allowances, that will reduce the amount of the carbon tax payable for any emissions year. The new Division is administered by the Minister charged with the responsibility for trade and industry, who may assign certain of his or her functions and powers under the new Division to a public body, whether or not under the responsibility of the Minister. Where such an assignment is made, members of the public body who are not from the public sector must not be involved in the carrying out of the function or the exercising of the power so delegated to the public body.\n\nWhere a taxable facility of a registered person is eligible for an allowance, the registered person will be granted an award of allowances, which will set out the methodology by which the allowance for each emissions year covered by the award of allowances is to be determined. Based on the methodology specified for any emissions year, the Minister will determine the actual quantum of the allowance for that emissions year.\n\nClause 14 amends section 21 to provide for the materials (other than past verified emissions reports) that the Agency may have regard to in assessing the total amount of reckonable GHG emissions of a business facility for an emissions year for which a registered person has not submitted a verified emissions report, or where any verified emissions report submitted is incomplete or inaccurate.\n\nClause 15 amends section 22 to clarify that the Agency may make an advance assessment even for the first emissions year for which the registered person is liable to pay the carbon tax. In such a situation, the Agency will not have issued any past assessments.\n\nClause 16 inserts a new subsection (1A) in section 23 to provide that registered persons cannot object to the amount of any allowances included in the notices of assessment issued to them by the Agency under section 21.\n\nClause 17 deletes and substitutes section 24 to provide for the waiver of assessments of carbon tax, to take into account changes in the carbon price.\n\nClauses 18 to 25 make various consequential amendments to the Division headings of Divisions 3 and 4 of Part 5 and to sections 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31.\n\nClause 26 inserts a new section 31A to provide for the conversion of fixed-price carbon credits in the fixed-price carbon credit registry account of a registered person, where these were purchased at a certain carbon price, and remain in that account when there is a change in the carbon price.\n\nClauses 27 and 28 make various consequential amendments to sections 32 and 33.\n\nClause 29 inserts new Divisions 5 and 6 of Part 5 to provide for various matters concerning eligible international carbon credits, the International Carbon Credits Registry and international carbon credit registry accounts.\n\nClause 30 makes a consequential amendment to section 34(1)(c).\n\nClause 31 amends section 37(2) to take into account changes in the carbon tax rate.\n\nClauses 32, 33 and 34 make various consequential amendments to sections 41, 42 and 44, respectively.\n\nClause 35 amends section 56 to align the methodology for determining the penalties for offences under that section, with that under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1993.\n\nClause 36 amends section 74 to clarify the power of the Minister to grant exemptions so as to permit partial compliance with any provision of the Act.\n\nClause 37 amends section 75 to empower the Agency to extend the time required for anything to be done under the Act by a person, even after the time sought to be extended has expired. However, the person must have applied to the Agency for the extension of time before the expiry of that time.\n\nClause 38 makes a consequential amendment to section 76(1).\n\nClause 39 deletes and substitutes the First Schedule to update the greenhouse gases in the First Schedule in conformity with the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, by adding to the list of hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons. The new First Schedule also updates the global warming potential of the greenhouse gases in the First Schedule according to that Report.\n\nClause 40 deletes item 1 (nitrogen trifluoride) in Part 2 of the Second Schedule. This is to make emissions of nitrogen trifluoride reckonable GHG emissions. The clause also amends Part 2 of the Second Schedule to include the additional hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons inserted in the new First Schedule, so as to provide for them to be non-reckonable GHG emissions.\n\nClause 41 amends the Third Schedule to provide for revisions to the carbon tax rate and the carbon price.\n\nClause 42 makes various consequential amendments to the Fifth Schedule.\n\nClause 43 provides for various saving and transitional matters, and empowers the Minister charged with the responsibility for sustainability and the environment to make regulations prescribing provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of any provision in the Bill.\n\nEXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC MONEY\n\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

Section 86 of the principal Act is amended by inserting, immediately after subsection (1), the following subsection:\n\n\u201c(1A) Without affecting subsection (1), the Minister may make regulations to prescribe the mode of payment for any refund under this Act in relation to any person or class of persons.\u201d.\n\nAmendment of section 90\n\n19.

The principal Act is amended by inserting, immediately after the Eighth Schedule, the following Schedule:\n\n\u201cNINTH SCHEDULE\n\nSection 20(2C)\n\nILLUSTRATIONS OF ARRANGEMENTS FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 20(2A)\n\nIllustration 1 \u2014 Missing trader in supply chain\n\nPersons A, B and C are registered under this Act. Person A supplies goods to Person B at a price that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person B supplies the same goods to Person C at a higher price (to earn a profit margin for Person B) that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person C exports the goods to an overseas Person D at a price that does not include tax chargeable on the supply to Person D (on the basis that an export of goods would be a zero-rated supply).\n\nPerson C claims a refund for the input tax paid to Person B and Person B accounts for the output tax on Person B\u2019s supply to Person C (less the input tax paid to Person A). Person A fails to account for the output tax on Person A\u2019s supply to Person B and becomes untraceable.\n\nThe arrangement causes loss of public revenue as a refund is made to Person C while Person A does not account for the output tax due from Person A.\n\nThis illustration applies equally to a supply of services, and if there are 2 or more intermediaries in the supply chain between Person A and Person C.\n\nIllustration 2 \u2014 Obstruction and obfuscation by intermediary\n\nPersons A, B and C are registered under this Act. Person A supplies goods to Person B at a price that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person B supplies the same goods to Person C at a higher price (to earn a profit margin for Person B) that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person C exports the goods to an overseas Person D at a price that does not include tax chargeable on the supply to Person D (on the basis that an export of goods would be a zero-rated supply).\n\nPerson C claims a refund for the input tax paid to Person B and Person B accounts for the output tax on Person B\u2019s supply to Person C (less the input tax paid to Person A). Person A fails to account for the output tax on Person A\u2019s supply to Person B, and Person B obfuscates the identity of Person A (for instance, by Person B becoming untraceable or keeping poor records).\n\nThe arrangement causes loss of public revenue as a refund is made to Person C while Person A does not account for the output tax due from Person A.\n\nThis illustration applies equally to a supply of services, and if there are 2 or more intermediaries in the supply chain between Person A and Person C.\n\nIllustration 3 \u2014 Inflation of value of supply\n\nPersons A, B and C are registered under this Act. Person A supplies goods to Person B at a price that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person B supplies the same goods to Person C at a higher price (to earn a profit margin for Person B) that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person C exports the goods to an overseas Person D at a price that does not include tax chargeable on the supply to Person D (on the basis that an export of goods would be a zero-rated supply).\n\nThe price charged by Person A to Person B for the goods is grossly excessive because the goods are counterfeit, of a poorer quality than described in the supply, or of a lower quantity than described in the supply.\n\nPerson C claims a refund for the input tax paid to Person B and Person B accounts for the output tax on Person B\u2019s supply to Person C (less the input tax paid to Person A). Given the inflated value of the goods, the refund is larger than what would otherwise be given. Person A fails to account for the output tax on Person A\u2019s supply to Person B, and it is not possible to recover the output tax from Person A (for instance, because Person A has little assets).\n\nThe arrangement causes loss of public revenue as, firstly, the refund to Person C is excessive, and, secondly, a refund is made to Person C while Person A does not account for the output tax due from Person A.\n\nThis illustration applies equally to a supply of services, and if there are 2 or more intermediaries in the supply chain between Person A and Person C.\n\nIllustration 4 \u2014 Offsetting input tax against tax on supplies made in another supply chain\n\nPersons A, B and C are registered under this Act. Person A supplies goods to Person B at a price that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person B supplies the same goods to Person C at a higher price (to earn a profit margin for Person B) that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person C exports the goods to an overseas Person D at a price that does not include tax chargeable on the supply to Person D (on the basis that an export of goods would be a zero-rated supply).\n\nPerson C sets off the input tax paid to Person B against the output tax charged on other supplies made to Person E (who is registered under this Act) to reduce the amount of the output tax otherwise payable by Person C to the Comptroller.\n\nPerson B accounts for the output tax on Person B\u2019s supply to Person C (less the input tax paid to Person A). Person A fails to account for the output tax on Person A\u2019s supply to Person B and it is not possible to recover the output tax from Person A.\n\nThe arrangement causes loss of public revenue as Person C has reduced the amount of the output tax otherwise payable by Person C to the Comptroller when Person C sets off the input tax paid to Person B against the output tax charged on other supplies made to Person E, while Person A does not account for the output tax due from Person A.\n\nThis illustration applies equally to a supply of services, and if there are 2 or more intermediaries in the supply chain between Person A and Person C.\n\nIllustration 5 \u2014 Assumption of identity of trader\n\nPerson A is not registered under this Act. Persons B, C and D are registered under this Act. Person A supplies goods to Person B using Person D\u2019s registration details, at a price that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person B supplies the same goods to Person C at a higher price (to earn a profit margin for Person B) that includes tax chargeable on the supply. Person C exports the goods to an overseas Person E at a price that does not include tax chargeable on the supply to Person E (on the basis that an export of goods would be a zero-rated supply).\n\nPerson C claims a refund for the input tax paid to Person B and Person B accounts for the output tax on Person B\u2019s supply to Person C (less the input tax paid to Person A).\n\nThe arrangement causes loss of public revenue as a refund is made to Person C while Person D does not account for any output tax to the Comptroller since Person D did not actually make the supply of goods to Person B.\n\nThis illustration applies equally to a supply of services, and if there are 2 or more intermediaries in the supply chain between Person A and Person C.\u201d.\n\nMiscellaneous amendments\n\n23.

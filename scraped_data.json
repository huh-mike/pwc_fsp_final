        "text": "{'content': 'The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has announced that over 1.9 million taxpayers will benefit from the No-Filing Service (NFS) for the upcoming tax season in 2025. The NFS automatically assesses the income of eligible taxpayers based on information provided by employers and other third parties. This service aims to simplify the tax filing process and reduce the administrative burden on taxpayers. Eligible taxpayers include those who have a salary income and do not have other sources of income. Taxpayers who qualify for the NFS will receive a notification from IRAS and will not need to file a tax return for the year. Additionally, close to 500,000 of these taxpayers will benefit from the Direct Notice of Assessment (D-NOA) initiative, which provides earlier tax bills based on their income information. Taxpayers on the NFS will receive a notification of their status by March 2025 and are reminded to verify their pre-filled information. The filing deadline for individual taxpayers is set for 18 April 2025, and all tax resident individuals will receive a rebate of 60% of tax payable, capped at $200. Changes to dependant-related tax reliefs and the Working Mother’s Child Relief (WMCR) have also been announced, with new income thresholds and fixed dollar amounts for reliefs. Taxpayers are encouraged to e-file their returns and use secure digital payment methods for their tax bills. IRAS warns taxpayers to be vigilant against scams and provides various channels for assistance.', 'urls': ['https://www.iras.gov.sg']}",

This requirement will be implemented progressively, starting from November 1, 2025, for newly incorporated companies that register for GST voluntarily, and from April 1, 2026, for all new voluntary GST-registrants. A soft launch for early adoption will begin on May 1, 2025. Businesses are encouraged to adopt InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to facilitate the transmission of invoice data to IRAS. The initiative aims to streamline invoicing processes, reduce manual errors, and enhance tax compliance. Businesses must ensure their solutions are compatible with the InvoiceNow network and register for a Peppol ID to transmit invoice data successfully. The adoption of these solutions is expected to bring various benefits, including improved efficiency and reduced compliance efforts.

The Guide also provides details to support GST-registered businesses to adopt the requirement.\n\nYou should read this Guide if:\n\n(a) you are required to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement as an additional condition to be voluntarily registered for GST; or\n\n(b) you do not fall within the GST InvoiceNow Requirement but would like to take up an InvoiceNow-Ready Solution to transmit invoice data to IRAS via the InvoiceNow network as an early adopter.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to be a technical specification for the GST InvoiceNow Requirement or for InvoiceNow. For system architects, software developers and IT support personnel of Access Points Providers, Solution Providers and businesses using their own in-house enterprise solutions, the relevant technical documents are available at APEX portal and IMDA’s InvoiceNow Technical Playbook. These documents provide details on the solutioning and cover the system implementation know-how.\n\nAt a Glance\n\nWith the announcement of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement, GST-registered businesses will be required to use InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to send invoice data directly to IRAS for tax administration. This will be done in phases, starting with the new voluntary GST registrants. The transmission of invoice data to IRAS will be done seamlessly through IMDA-accredited Access Point Providers via Application Programming Interface (“API”) technology.\n\nThis move is in line with international trends, with governments worldwide actively promoting the adoption of e-invoicing for tax administration. The phased adoption of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement follows a pilot by IRAS, IMDA, businesses and service providers between Sep 2020 and Jun 2023.\n\nTo allow businesses sufficient lead time to prepare, the GST InvoiceNow Requirement will be implemented in a calibrated and progressive manner as follows:\n\n(a) From 1 Nov 2025, for newly incorporated companies (incorporated within 6 months from the time they submit the application for GST registration) that apply for voluntary GST registration.\n\n(b) From 1 Apr 2026, for all new voluntary GST registrants, regardless of incorporation date or business constitution.\n\nA soft launch will commence from 1 May 2025, allowing non-mandatory participation from any existing GST-registered businesses and those applying for GST registration on / after 1 May 2025 that wish to be early adopters to transmit invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nAdopting InvoiceNow will help businesses better fulfil their responsibilities as GST-registered businesses, by facilitating record-keeping, billing, and payment processes. In particular, it supports new GST-registered businesses to get their compliance right from the start.\n\nThere are plans to progressively extend mandatory participation to new compulsory GST registrants and remaining GST-registered businesses. We will continue to consult industry partners and carefully review the feedback received before announcing further details.\n\nGlossary\n\nInvoiceNow\n\nInvoiceNow refers to Singapore’s nationwide e-invoicing network that is based on the international standard called “Peppol”. It connects all businesses and facilitates the transmission of invoices within the InvoiceNow network in a standardised manner.\n\nGST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nThe GST InvoiceNow Requirement is a joint initiative between IRAS and IMDA to digitalise invoicing and facilitate the submission of invoice data by GST-registered businesses to IRAS by leveraging the InvoiceNow network. GST-registered businesses that are required to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement will be required to use InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to send invoice data to IRAS for tax administration.\n\nInvoice Data\n\nThe data to be transmitted covers all data on invoices or equivalent documents that serve as bills for payment (or adjustments of bill for payment) for supplies and purchases made. Below are some examples of such documents:\n\nDocuments that serve as bill for payment (considered as invoice data)\n\n• Sales invoice\n• Tax invoice\n• Simplified tax invoice\n• Serially numbered receipts\n• Debit notes\n• Credit notes\n\nThe above documents are collectively referred to as “invoice”, and their data are referred to as “invoice data” in this e-Tax Guide.\n\nIn situations where a supply or purchase does not entail the issuance of an invoice, businesses should still transmit the data that they record into their accounting system. This could happen, for example, when related entities make supplies to each other but opt to settle by offsetting their accounts receivable/payable in lieu of issuing invoices and making payment.\n\nInvoiceNow-Ready Solutions\n\nInvoiceNow-Ready Solutions are accounting and finance software that facilitate the transmission of invoices between businesses via the InvoiceNow network. They can be purchased off-the-shelf or be customised specifically for businesses in the form of proprietary enterprise resource planning systems.\n\nInvoiceNow-Ready Solutions connected to IRAS through IMDA-accredited Access Points will enable the transmission of invoice data to IRAS via API technology. IMDA will publish the list of IMDA-accredited InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions that are connected to IRAS by May 2025.\n\nInvoiceNow-Ready Solution Provider (“IRSP”) and IMDA-accredited Access Point Provider (“AP”)\n\nIRSPs are providers offering accounting or finance solutions which are connected to the InvoiceNow network via IMDA-accredited Access Points.\n\nAPs create and maintain the connectivity gateways i.e. Access Points that function as access nodes on the InvoiceNow network; they also ensure compliance to the Peppol standards and routing of invoices to the correct destination Access Points.\n\nThe differences between an IRSP and an AP are summarised below:\n\nRole\n\nIRSP\n\nAP\n\nWhat services do they provide?\n\n• Build the software features to support the GST InvoiceNow Requirement and connectivity to the Access Points\n\n• Connect IRSPs and businesses with in-house enterprise solutions to the InvoiceNow network\n\n• Businesses will have to rely on separate accounting or finance solutions to perform accounting and finance functions\n\n• IRSPs provide solutions with different capabilities, ranging from simple and free-of-charge invoicing functions to a full suite of accounting and finance functions\n\nPeppol Invoice and Peppol Submission Method\n\nA Peppol invoice refers to an invoice created and transmitted from the supplier to the customer through the InvoiceNow network. Both the supplier and the customer must be on the InvoiceNow network before the supplier can issue a Peppol invoice to the customer.\n\nIn the Peppol submission method, a copy of the Peppol invoice data is automatically transmitted to IRAS when the Peppol invoice is routed from the supplier to the customer through the InvoiceNow network.\n\nSolution-extracted Invoice and Solution-extracted Submission Method\n\nA solution-extracted invoice refers to:\n\n(a) A non-Peppol invoice issued outside the InvoiceNow network for supplies and recorded into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. Non-Peppol invoices include paper/PDF invoices issued to individuals or customers who are not on the network.\n\n(b) A purchase invoice that is recorded into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nIn the solution-extracted submission method, a copy of the solution-extracted invoice data is automatically extracted from the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution and transmitted to IRAS regularly (e.g. daily or weekly).\n\nPeppol ID\n\nThe Peppol ID is the unique address that enables companies, organizations, and authorities to receive business messages, such as e-invoices and e-orders, via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nSG Peppol Directory\n\nThe SG Peppol Directory is a facility for searching Singapore businesses that are registered on the InvoiceNow network. The SG Peppol Directory allows businesses to search for other companies registered on the InvoiceNow network to send and receive e-invoices electronically through the nationwide e-invoicing network.\n\nIRSPs and APs will need to assist businesses to register for Peppol ID and update the businesses’ details in the Service Metadata Publisher (“SMP”), so that businesses can be listed on the SG Peppol Directory.\n\nInvoiceNow\n\nLaunched in 2019, InvoiceNow is a nationwide e-invoicing network that is based on the Peppol standard. Managed by Infocomm Media Development Authority (“IMDA”), which is appointed as Singapore’s Peppol Authority, InvoiceNow aims to connect all active businesses and encourage digitalisation through the direct transmission of invoices in standard digital format between suppliers and customers, from one finance system to another.\n\nWithin the InvoiceNow network, invoices are exchanged using a common Extensible Markup Language (or “XML”) format known as the Business Interoperability Specification Billing 3.0 Universal Business Language (or “BIS Billing 3.0 UBL”). This common standard allows users to adopt their preferred solutions, while being able to exchange invoices with their partners who may not be using the same solution but are on InvoiceNow. An upgrade to the Singapore BIS Bill 3.0 UBL Specification (“SG Peppol BIS 3.0”) called the Singapore Peppol International (“PINT-SG”) Specification was launched in Feb 2024. This upgraded specification enables users to experience seamless cross-border transactions. PINT-SG is also the base data format used to support the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nThe process of sending and receiving invoices in PDF format via email is not considered e-invoicing. Even though both supplier and customer issue and receive the invoice digitally in both scenarios, the customer who receives an invoice in PDF format would still need to record the details of the invoice into its own accounting system. On the other hand, the details of the invoice issued via InvoiceNow will be transmitted directly into the customer’s accounting system without human intervention. This speeds up invoice processing, which results in faster digital payment, and greatly reduces the time spent verifying invoices and receiving payment.\n\nCurrent process of sending and receiving paper or PDF invoices\n\nThis process is not considered e-invoicing.\n\nThe illustration below gives an overview of the 4-corner model under InvoiceNow. In any given business transaction, the supplier can send its invoice directly to the InvoiceNow-Ready accounting or finance solution of the customer, using the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution of the supplier’s choice. The supplier will utilise the necessary information in the SG Peppol Directory to identify the customer and create the invoice. The created invoice will be sent by the supplier (“Corner 1”) to the supplier’s Access Point (“Corner 2”) to facilitate the transmission of the invoice to the customer’s Access Point (“Corner 3”), before it is transmitted to the customer (“Corner 4”). Businesses on the network can use an InvoiceNow-Ready accounting or finance solution of their choice. Once connected to InvoiceNow, the business will effectively be connected to all other businesses that are on the InvoiceNow network.\n\nBenefits of using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions\n\nThe adoption of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions offers the following advantages as compared to the traditional paper or PDF-based invoicing:\n\n(a) Streamlined processes: InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions enable direct transmission of e-invoices in a structured data format across different finance systems, thereby eliminating manual work involved in sending, receipting and recording of invoices into systems.\n\n(b) Reduced errors and costs: InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions reduce manual processes, along with errors and rectification costs. With invoice records maintained electronically, such solutions also reduce invoice storage and retrieval costs.\n\n(c) Improved cashflow management: InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions facilitate quicker invoice processing and payment, helping businesses to more effectively manage their cashflow.\n\nFor more information about InvoiceNow, please refer to the InvoiceNow FAQs or visit IMDA’s website www.imda.gov.sg/invoicenow.\n\nGST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nTo support the nationwide InvoiceNow initiative, and as part of our ongoing transformation efforts to digitalise with the wider ecosystem and integrate tax into taxpayers’ accounting and payroll systems, GST-registered businesses will be required to use InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to send invoice data to IRAS for tax administration.\n\nHow GST InvoiceNow Requirement works\n\nUnder the requirement, GST-registered businesses will need to submit invoice data pertaining to their GST supplies and purchases to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions and via the InvoiceNow network. Invoices that are not issued using InvoiceNow (e.g. for supplies made to businesses not on the InvoiceNow network or supplies made via point-of-sale systems) should also be sent to IRAS when they are recorded in the accounting system. More details on the scope of transactions can be found in the “Scope of Invoice Data to Transmit” section below.\n\nIRAS is connected to the InvoiceNow network, via the Access Point, to receive copies of the invoice data transmitted through the InvoiceNow network, whenever businesses transact. This is achieved through the introduction of a 5th corner to the 4-corner model under InvoiceNow.\n\nThe transmission of invoice data to IRAS will be performed via API technology. When businesses activate the GST InvoiceNow Submission feature in their InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to transmit invoice data to IRAS, IRAS will receive a copy of the invoice data whenever businesses issue or receive invoices via the InvoiceNow network, or record invoices into their InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions.\n\nAdditional benefits for adopting InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to transmit invoice data to IRAS\n\nBesides enjoying the benefits of InvoiceNow, GST-registered businesses that transmit invoice data to IRAS can also benefit from reduced compliance efforts when preparing data for submission to IRAS.\n\nWith IRAS’ better risk analysis capabilities, fewer businesses would potentially be selected for GST audits. Those selected for audits may also expect shorter audits and faster resolution of the audit issues. Businesses claiming GST refunds may also receive refunds earlier, if assessed to be of lower risks.\n\nFurthermore, businesses would have access to the array of value-added services provided by the InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions, which help to ease tax compliance. IRSPs are able to build validation checks into the submission process to detect wrongful GST charges from non-GST registered suppliers. These can be done by calling IRAS’ Check GST Register API and checking the validity of the supplier’s GST registration number based on invoice parameters before triggering alerts on the issuance of the invoice or potential wrongful GST charges to the party who processes the invoice, thus helping businesses to avoid incorrect input tax claims.\n\nIn the longer term, as adoption and usage of InvoiceNow by GST-registered businesses increase, it would open up the possibility for the development of new value-added services, e.g. pre-filing “health check” report on potential errors or pre-filing assistance provided by IRSPs to help businesses, particularly those with simpler business model, to complete and submit GST returns directly to IRAS, with greater ease. This would help redefine and elevate businesses’ GST compliance experience.\n\nCurrent experience\n\nPossible redefined experience with increased InvoiceNow adoption\n\nGST Return preparation\n\n• Separate effort to check for wrongful charging of GST by non-GST suppliers\n\n• Perform own checks on GST transactions before filing\n\nGST Return filing\n\n• Manually prepare and check GST returns against their GST transactions before filing on IRAS’ portal\n\n• Receive automated alerts in the accounting software on wrongful GST charging from non-GST suppliers when invoices are received\n\n• Receive pre-filing “health check” report in the accounting software on potential errors\n\n• More assurance to business that GST returns are accurate, with fewer discrepancies.\n\n• Pre-filing assistance provided by IRSP to help businesses complete and submit returns directly to IRAS.\n\nPost-filing audits or refunds\n\n• Audit selection based on aggregated data (in GST returns) and risk attributes\n\n• Less likely for businesses with low compliance risk to get selected for audit, due to IRAS’ better risk analysis capabilities.\n\n• If audited, additional time to extract, prepare and submit listings/documents\n\n• Receive GST refunds more expeditiously, if assessed to be of lower risks\n\nPhased Adoption of GST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nGST-registered businesses will be required to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement progressively, starting with mandatory participation by the following groups of businesses:\n\n(a) From 1 Nov 2025, for newly incorporated companies that register for GST voluntarily. The newly incorporated companies refer to companies that are incorporated within 6 months from the time they submit their application for GST registration to IRAS.\n\n(b) From 1 Apr 2026, for all new voluntary GST registrants, regardless of incorporation date or business constitution.\n\nThe above mandatory participation is not applicable to new compulsory GST registrants.\n\nThe GST InvoiceNow Requirement will be implemented as an additional condition for voluntary GST registration. Businesses that need to comply with the requirement will need to obtain a Peppol ID before they apply to IRAS for voluntary GST registration.\n\nA soft launch for early adoption will commence from 1 May 2025. IRAS encourages all GST-registered businesses and businesses applying for GST registration on / after 1 May 2025 to transmit invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nWe strongly recommend all GST-registered businesses and businesses that intend to register for GST to come onboard early and plan ahead for the adoption of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions to be compatible with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nThere are plans to progressively extend mandatory participation to new compulsory GST registrants and remaining GST-registered businesses. We will continue to consult industry partners and carefully review the feedback received before announcing further details.\n\nMay 2025\n\n1 Nov 2025\n\n1 Apr 2026\n\n• GST-registered businesses that wish to be early adopters can adopt InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions and start to transmit invoice data to IRAS.\n\n• Newly incorporated companies that voluntarily apply for GST registration are required to send invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions.\n\n• All new voluntary GST registrants are required to send invoice data to IRAS using InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions.\n\nNewly Incorporated Companies that Register for GST Voluntarily from 1 Nov 2025\n\nYou will need to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement if:\n\n(a) Your business is a company;\n\n(b) You are applying for voluntary GST registration on or after 1 Nov 2025; and\n\n(c) The date of incorporation of your business is within 6 months from the application date of voluntary GST registration.\n\nPlease see examples below that illustrate the above conditions.\n\nExample 1\n\nCompany A was newly incorporated on 2 May 2025. It will apply for voluntary GST registration on 2 Nov 2025.\n\nAs Company A’s incorporation date (2 May 2025) is within 6 months from the application of its voluntary GST registration (2 Nov 2025), it is required to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nExample 2\n\nCompany B was newly incorporated on 9 May 2025. It will apply for voluntary GST registration on 10 Nov 2025.\n\nAs Company B’s incorporation date (9 May 2025) is more than 6 months before the date of its application for voluntary GST registration, it is not mandatory for Company B to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement for now.\n\nBusinesses that Register for GST Voluntarily from 1 Apr 2026\n\nYou will need to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement if you are applying for voluntary GST registration on or after 1 Apr 2026.\n\nPlease see example below that illustrates the above condition.\n\nExample 3\n\nCompany C was incorporated on 1 Jan 2024. It is applying for voluntary GST registration on 15 Apr 2026.\n\nAs Company C’s application date for voluntary GST registration is after 1 Apr 2026, Company C is required to adopt the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nBusinesses Excluded from the GST InvoiceNow Requirement\n\nWe recognise that there are practical difficulties for certain groups of businesses to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement. Hence, we have excluded the following businesses from the requirement:\n\nExcluded Businesses\n\nOverseas entities\n\nBusinesses that are liable to register for GST wholly due to the Reverse Charge regime\n\nRefers to entities belonging outside Singapore for GST purposes, including those that are required to appoint local agents (i.e. section 33(1) agents) to handle their GST matters.\n\nThis includes Overseas Vendors that are registered for GST under the Overseas Vendor Registration (“OVR”) Pay-only regime and OVR full regime.\n\nRefers to businesses that are liable to register for GST solely by virtue of the imported services that they are making, and/or importation of Low-Value Goods (“LVG”) due to reverse charge (“RC”) rules. \n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, businesses that make some RC transactions but did not register for GST solely by virtue of the RC rules will not be classified as “Excluded Businesses”. Such businesses will need to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nPlease refer to Annex D for more details on determining whether your business qualifies as an Excluded Business.\n\nHow Invoice Data will be Transmitted to IRAS\n\nBroadly, there are four types of submissions for transmitting invoice data to IRAS:\n\nType of submission\n\nDescription\n\nType 1A Submission\n\nSupply transaction made by the supplier within the InvoiceNow network\n\nType 1B Submission\n\nCorresponding purchase transaction received by the customer within the InvoiceNow network from the supply transaction under Type 1A Submission above\n\nPeppol/Solution-extracted invoice submission method\n\nPeppol invoice\n\nPeppol\n\nSolution-extracted invoice\n\nType 2 Submission\n\nSupply transaction made outside the InvoiceNow network\n\nSolution-extracted invoice\n\nType 3 Submission\n\nPurchase transaction made outside the InvoiceNow network\n\nSolution-extracted invoice submission method\n\nSolution-extracted submission method\n\nSolution-extracted submission method\n\nType 1A and 1B Submissions: Supply Transaction and Corresponding Purchase Transaction made within InvoiceNow Network\n\nFor a supply transaction made within the InvoiceNow network (e.g., where both the GST-registered supplier and the customer are connected to IRAS via the InvoiceNow network), the transmission of the invoice data to IRAS occurs in the following manner:\n\nType 1A Submission: Supply Transaction made within InvoiceNow Network (i.e., Peppol Invoice)\n\n(a) GST-registered supplier issues a Peppol invoice for a supply transaction using its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution via the InvoiceNow network and sends the invoice to its Access Point.\n\nIRSPs that have built in validation checks on wrongful GST charges would detect invoices from suppliers that wrongly charge GST and trigger an alert to the sender (i.e. the supplier) for his attention. For more information on this, please refer to the “Validation Checks” section.\n\n(b) Supplier’s AP forwards the invoice to the customer’s Access Point.\n\n(c) Once the invoice data is successfully sent to the customer’s Access Point, a copy of the Peppol invoice will be transmitted to IRAS automatically.\n\n(d) Customer’s Access Point forwards the invoice to the customer.\n\nType 1B Submission: Corresponding Purchase Transaction received by the Customer within InvoiceNow Network from the Supply Transaction under Type 1A Submission (i.e., Solution-extracted Invoice)\n\n(e) GST-registered customer receives, validates and accepts the invoice in its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nThis would include indicating the appropriate GST Category Code(s) for purchases, the taxable purchase amount and input tax amount that the customer wishes to claim. The practice is in line with the typical process today when businesses record their purchases in their accounting systems.\n\n(f) A copy of the recorded purchase invoice is transmitted to IRAS by way of a Solution-extracted invoice through the customer’s Access Point.\n\nType 2 Submission: Supply Transaction made outside the InvoiceNow Network (i.e., Solution-extracted invoice)\n\nFor a supply transaction made outside the InvoiceNow network (e.g., where the customer is not on the InvoiceNow network, or where the transactions are made using point-of-sale (“POS”) systems or to customers who are individuals), the transmission of the invoice data to IRAS occurs in the following manner:\n\n(a) GST-registered supplier issues a paper/PDF invoice for the supply transaction to the customer and records the transaction in its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nIRSPs that have built in the validation check on wrongful GST charges, which would help detect invoices from suppliers that wrongly charge GST and trigger an alert to the sender (which in this case is the supplier) for his attention.\n\n(b) A Solution-extracted invoice for the supply transaction is submitted to the supplier’s Access Point.\n\n(c) Supplier’s Access Point transmits the Solution-extracted invoice to IRAS.\n\nType 3 Submission: Purchase Transaction made outside InvoiceNow Network (i.e., Solution-extracted invoice)\n\nFor a purchase transaction made outside the InvoiceNow network (e.g., where the GST-registered supplier is not on the InvoiceNow network, or where the transaction(s) involve petty cash purchases (or PCPs), the transmission of the invoice data to IRAS occurs in the following manner:\n\n(a) The GST-registered customer receives a paper/PDF invoice for the purchase transaction and records the transaction in its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nIRSPs that have built in the validation check on wrongful GST charges, which would help detect invoices from suppliers that wrongly charge GST and trigger an alert to the sender (which in this case is the customer) for his attention.\n\nThe customer sends a Solution-extracted invoice for the purchase transaction to its Access Point.\n\nCustomer’s Access Point transmits the Solution-extracted invoice to IRAS.\n\nTransmitting Credit Notes\n\nFrom time to time, suppliers may issue credit notes to their customers to adjust the taxable value and GST amount in the original invoices, for example, to correct mistakes in the original invoices or to adjust for sales discounts/rebates. Invoice data on such credit note transactions needs to be transmitted to IRAS as well.\n\nThe approach for transmitting credit notes would be the same as the approach for transmitting invoice data stated in paragraphs 6.2 to 6.4 above. More details on how to perform the submission of credit notes can be found in the “Invoicing Guidance for Common GST Scenarios” section test.\n\nScope of Invoice Data to Transmit\n\nTo simplify the data collection rules under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement, GST-registered businesses are required to transmit to IRAS invoice data that is reported in the GST return, other than specific excluded transactions (“Excluded Transactions”).\n\nIn general, such Excluded Transactions have no underlying supplies or purchases but are reported solely for GST purposes (e.g. deemed supplies), or the value and timing of invoice data to be submitted to IRAS are difficult to determine (in the case of supplies of financial services).\n\nWhat Businesses need to transmit under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement:\n\n+ All standard-rated supplies\n+ All zero-rated supplies\n+ All exempt supplies\n+ All standard-rated purchases\n+ All zero-rated purchases\n– Excluded Transactions\n\nPlease refer to the tables below for more details.\n\nInvoice Data Reported in the GST Return – Mandatory to Transmit to IRAS\n\nType Supplies/Purchases\n\nStandard-rated supplies\n\nExamples of Data to Transmit\n\nLocal sales of goods and services:\n\n• Supplies where GST is disregarded or suspended under certain GST schemes e.g., Approved Contract Manufacturer and Trader\n\nGST Category Codes\n\n• SR\n• NA\n• SRCA-S\n• SROVR-RS\n• SROVR-LVG\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, businesses that make some RC transactions but did not register for GST solely by virtue of the RC rules will not be classified as “Excluded Businesses”. Such businesses will need to comply with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nZero-rated supplies\n\n• Export sales of goods\n• Provision of international services\n• Sale or lease of residential properties\n• Local sale of investment precious metals\n\n• ZR\n• ES33\n• ESN33\n\nStandard-rated purchases\n\n• Purchases with input tax claims, e.g. purchase of business inventories from GST-registered suppliers\n• Purchases where input tax is directly attributable to Regulation 33 exempt supplies and non-Regulation 33 exempt supplies\n• Purchases where input tax claims are residual in nature\n• Purchases under certain GST schemes e.g. GMS, AMFT and Approved 3rd Party Logistics Company (“A3PL”) scheme\n• Purchases where Customer Accounting is applied\n\n• TX\n• TX-ESS\n• TX-N33\n• TX-RE\n• TXNA\n• TXCA\n\nZero-rated purchases\n\n• Purchase of goods that are exported\n• Purchase of international services e.g. international freight charges, IDD calls\n\n• ZP\n\nExcluded Transactions – Excluded from Scope\n\nType of Supplies/Purchases\n\nStandard-rated supplies\n\nTransactions to Exclude\n\n• Deemed supplies (e.g. free goods)\n• Reverse charge supplies on which businesses are required to account GST\n\nZero-rated supplies\n\n• Goods exported without actual sales\n• All exempt financial services that qualify for zero-rating\n• All exempt digital payment tokens (“DPT”) that qualify for zero-rating\n\nExempt supplies\n\n• All exempt financial services\n• All exempt DPTs, such as:\n- Exchange of DPTs for fiat currency or other DPTs\n- Loan of DPTs\n\nStandard-rated purchases\n\n• Import permits for importation of goods\n• Reverse charge purchases on which businesses are entitled to input tax claims\n• Goods and services purchased by overseas headquarters (or overseas branches) of a Singapore branch\n\nInvoice Data Not Reported in the GST Return – Excluded from Scope\n\nType of Supplies/Purchases\n\nOut-of-scope supplies\n\nTransactions to Exclude\n\nAll out-of-scope supplies, such as:\n\n• Third country sales of goods\n• Services supplied by overseas headquarters or branches\n\nTypes of purchases\n\nNon-reportable purchases\n\nAll non-reportable purchases, such as:\n\n• Purchases from non-GST registered suppliers\n• Purchases where input tax is blocked e.g. motor car expenses\n• Purchases that are exempted from GST\n• Out-of-scope purchases from GST-registered suppliers\n\nList of GST Category Codes Accepted by IRAS\n\nA comprehensive list of GST category codes accepted by IRAS can be found in Annex E.\n\nThis standardised set of GST category codes is provided to enable businesses to classify their supply and purchase transactions. Businesses are encouraged to incorporate the standardised set of GST category codes into their InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions or systems and use it to tag their transactions for submission to IRAS.\n\nSome businesses may wish to continue to use their internal tax codes as per their current business processes. Such businesses will have to work with their IRSPs or APs to map their internal tax codes to the list of accepted GST category codes before submitting the invoice data to IRAS.\n\nSubmission of Invoice Data with Supplies that Fall Within and Outside the Scope\n\nIf the invoice or credit note has a line item that pertains to invoice data that falls within the scope of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement above, then the invoice data relating to the entire invoice or credit note must be transmitted to IRAS under the requirement.\n\nExample 4\n\nCompany D issues a tax invoice to its tenant for the following:\n\n• A one-month refundable security deposit\n• Lease rental for Apr to Jun 2026\n\nIt charges and accounts GST solely on the lease rental. The refundable security deposit is outside the scope of GST.\n\nAs the invoice contains a standard-rated supply, which is within the scope, Company D is required to transmit the entire invoice data to IRAS.\n\nOption to Transmit All Supplies and Purchases Invoice Data\n\nBusinesses may opt to transmit invoice data on transactions that fall outside the scope of the requirement if doing so eases their compliance burden. For instance, businesses may opt to transmit to IRAS invoice data relating to all transactions, including out-of-scope supply transactions, rather than to exclude the latter. Businesses will need to work with IRSPs (if applicable) and APs to enable this.\n\nSubmission of Purchase Invoice Data where Input Tax is not Claimed in Full\n\nIf the businesses incur any purchases with input tax for both business and non-business purposes, they should submit the purchase invoice data for the claimable portion only. Businesses can do this by applying the relevant GST category code for the claimable portion for submission to IRAS. Alternatively, businesses may choose to submit the entire invoice for ease of compliance. The businesses should adopt its chosen approach for its invoice data submissions consistently.\n\nExample 5\n\nCompany E incurs mobile phone expenses amounting to S$7,000 (before GST), and GST of S$630. As the mobile phone expenses are incurred for both business and personal calls, Company E wishes to apply a proxy of 4/7 to apportion the portion of the expense as incurred for business purpose.\n\nAssuming the general input tax claiming conditions are met, strictly speaking, Company E should apply the GST category code TX and submit S$4,000 as the value of standard-rated purchases and S$360 as the amount of input tax to IRAS as its purchase invoice data under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nAlternatively, Company E may choose to submit S$7,000 as the value of standard-rated purchases and S$630 as the amount of input tax even if Company E only claims 4/7 of the mobile phone expenses, if doing so eases compliance. However, Company E must apply the same approach consistently for all its input tax that is not claimed in full.\n\nOption to Submit Invoice Data on an Aggregated Basis\n\nBusinesses may not be able to submit certain invoice data at a transactional level. They are thus allowed to aggregate their transactions before transmitting to IRAS for the following scenarios:\n\n(a) Supplies made via point-of-sale (“POS”) systems e.g. cash registers;\n\n(b) Supplies where simplified tax invoices (“STI”) are issued. Serially numbered receipts are considered as STI transactions; or\n\n(c) Petty cash purchases (“PCP”) e.g. staff claims and purchases using corporate cards.\n\nOnly POS, STI and PCP transactions can be submitted to IRAS on an aggregated basis. Businesses are not allowed to aggregate any other transactions for submissions to IRAS.\n\nAggregated invoice data will be sent to IRAS in the form of solution-extracted invoices.\n\nExample 6\n\nCompany F is a retail store which issues serially printed receipts via its POS system to its customers. As the customers are not on InvoiceNow network, the receipts are not issued via the InvoiceNow network.\n\nTo transmit the invoice data on the supplies made to IRAS, Company F may aggregate the daily POS sales and record the information into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution as one single solution-extracted invoice for transmission to IRAS at a regular interval and before the submission due date.\n\nAs the invoice is submitted on an aggregated basis, certain mandatory data elements (“MDEs”) may be defaulted to “POS”.\n\nExample 7\n\nCompany G adopts an employee expense system where staff claims are processed into its accounting system on a weekly basis.\n\nTo transmit the invoice data on the purchases to IRAS, Company G may aggregate the employee expenses and record the information into the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution as a single solution-extracted invoice for transmission to IRAS at a regular interval (weekly in Company G’s case) and before the submission due date.\n\nAs the invoice is submitted on an aggregated basis, certain MDEs may be defaulted to “PCP”.\n\nFor more details on how to complete the Mandatory Data Elements (“MDEs”) for the submission of aggregated invoice data, refer to the relevant examples at Annex A (for supplies invoice data submissions) and Annex C (for purchases invoice data submissions) respectively.\n\nBulk Submission of Invoice Data\n\nBusinesses will be able to perform bulk submissions of invoice data to IRAS via API. Each bulk submission data package can contain a maximum of 10 documents of the same invoice type (e.g. up to 10 invoices or 10 credit notes) and each data package should not be more than 10 MB in total data size.\n\nBusinesses may speak to their AP and/or IRSP to find out more on how they can perform bulk submissions.\n\nDue Date for Transmitting Invoice Data\n\nThe supplies or purchase invoice data must be transmitted to IRAS by the earlier of:\n\n(a) The date on which the relevant GST return is filed; or\n\n(b) The filing due date of the relevant GST return.\n\nThe “relevant GST return” refers to the GST return covering the prescribed accounting period when the date of the transaction occurs.\n\nThe date of the transaction is determined as follows:\n\nTypes of Transaction\n\nDate of Transaction\n\nSupplies data\n\nFor a supply where an invoice is or to be issued, the date of transaction would be the issuance date of the document; and\n\nFor all other supplies, the date of transaction would be the date the transaction is posted into the accounting system.\n\nPurchases data\n\nFor a purchase where the supplier’s invoice or an equivalent document is to be issued, the date of transaction would either be the:\n\n(a) Issuance date of the document; or\n\n(b) Date the transaction is posted into the accounting system.\n\nFor all other purchases, the date of transaction would be the date the transaction is posted into the accounting system.\n\nIRAS recommends that data extraction be carried out regularly (e.g. daily or weekly) to avoid any delays.\n\nExample 8\n\nCompany H issues a tax invoice to its customer on 20 Mar 2026 and files the GST return for prescribed accounting period 1 Jan to 31 Mar 2026 on 20 Apr 2026.\n\nAs the date of transaction is based on invoice date, the transaction falls within the prescribed accounting period 1 Jan to 31 Mar 2026. Company H must submit the invoice data relating to the supply of goods to the customer by 20 Apr 2026, which is the earlier of the filing date (20 Apr 2026) or filing due date (30 Apr 2026).\n\nExample 9\n\nCompany J receives a tax invoice dated 20 Mar 2026 and files GST return for the prescribed accounting period 1 Jan to 31 Mar 2026 on 15 May 2026. Company J is late in filing as the filing due date is 30 Apr 2026.\n\nAs the date of transaction is based on invoice date, the transaction falls within the prescribed accounting period 1 Jan to 31 Mar 2026. Company J must submit the invoice data relating to this purchase by 30 Apr 2026, which is the earlier of the filing date (15 May 2026) or filing due date (30 Apr 2026).\n\nAdvance Payments\n\nBusinesses may receive advance payments from their customers, before tax invoices are issued.\n\nThe business does not need to create a separate invoice to submit the invoice data at the time the advance payment is received. It may submit the invoice data to IRAS subsequently when the invoice is issued to the customer.\n\nExample 10\n\nCompany K issues a pro-forma invoice to Company L for the collection of advance payment. Company K will only issue the tax invoice when the goods are ready for delivery to Company L.\n\nAs the pro-forma invoice is not considered a bill of payment, Company K is not required to submit the invoice data when it issues the pro-forma invoice or receives the advance payment from Company L. Company K will submit the invoice data to IRAS only when it issues the tax invoice.\n\nSubmission of Invoice Data before the Business is GST-registered, i.e. Pre-registration GST claims\n\nBusinesses are required to submit invoice data for transactions that fall on and after the date the business become GST-registered.\n\nAs such, businesses are not required to submit invoice data for pre-registration GST claims on purchases. Nonetheless, businesses are required to maintain proper records and documentary evidence to support their pre-registration claims.\n\nExample 11\n\nCompany M is GST-registered with effect from 1 Jun 2026. It has received tax invoices with GST charged and has made payment for them prior to its GST registration. It will claim these pre-registration GST claims in its first GST return for the prescribed accounting period 1 Apr to 30 Jun 2026.\n\nNotwithstanding that Company M will be making the pre-registration GST claims in its GST return, Company M is not required to submit the invoice data relating to pre-registration GST claims under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nSubmission of Invoice Data after the Business Ceased to be GST-registered\n\nBusinesses are required to submit invoice data for transactions up to the last day of their GST-registration. Supplies made by a business that has cancelled its GST registration may straddle its GST de-registration date. For example, the business may supply a service or deliver goods before its de-registration date but issues an invoice and receives payment for that service only after it has de-registered from GST. While the business must account for the output tax on the supply in its final GST F8 return, the business is not required to submit the invoice data relating to this supply to IRAS, if the invoice is issued after the business has ceased to be GST-registered. Nonetheless, the businesses are required to maintain proper records and documentary evidence to support their supplies and purchases straddling their GST de-registration date.\n\nExample 12\n\nCompany N sells and delivers goods worth S$10,000 on 20 Jun 2027 before it was de-registered from GST on 1 Jul 2027. The final GST F8 return covers the prescribed accounting period 1 Apr to 30 Jun 2027.\n\nAs the invoice was issued after Company N ceased to be GST-registered, Company N is not required to submit the invoice data to IRAS.\n\nBusinesses may also receive invoices that are dated after their GST de-registration date, for supplies of services performed or goods delivered/made available before their GST de-registration date.\n\nThe business is not required to submit the invoice data relating to this purchase, if the invoice date falls outside the business’s GST registration period.\n\nExample 13\n\nCompany O receives a supplier’s tax invoice dated 5 Jul 2027 for services rendered on 20 Jun 2027. Company O was de-registered from GST with effect from 1 Jul 2027 and the final GST F8 return covers the prescribed accounting period 1 Apr to 30 Jun 2027.\n\nAs the invoice is dated after Company O has ceased to be GST-registered, Company O is not required to submit the invoice data to IRAS.\n\nMandatory Data Elements\n\nIRAS has identified a set of essential data elements that must be present in the invoice data sent to IRAS. This set of data elements is in line with the existing GST content requirements of a tax invoice and other invoices set out by the Comptroller under Regulations 11 and 13 of the GST (General) Regulations of the GST Act and facilitates the use of the invoice data for tax administration purposes.\n\nWhen transmitting invoice data to IRAS, the supplies and purchase invoices and credit notes must contain the following mandatory data elements (“MDEs”):\n\nMDEs present in both Invoice and Credit Note\n\nSupplier Details\n\nSupplier Endpoint ID\n\nSupplier Scheme ID\n\nSupplier ID\n\nSupplier GSTN\n\nSupplier Tax Scheme ID\n\nCustomer Details\n\nSupplier Name\n\nSupplier Address – Address Line 1\n\nSupplier Address – Postal Code\n\nSupplier Address – Country Code\n\nCustomer Endpoint ID\n\nCustomer Scheme ID\n\nCustomer ID\n\nCustomer Name\n\nCustomer Address – Address Line 1\n\nCustomer Address – Postal Code\n\nCustomer Address – Country Code\n\nMDEs present in Invoice\n\nCustomization ID\n\nInvoice Line Identifier\n\nProfile ID\n\nItem Name\n\nDoc UUID\n\nUnit\n\nInvoice Number\n\nQuantity\n\nItem Net Price\n\nInvoice Issue Date\n\nInvoice Type Code (i.e., invoice or credit note)\n\nItem GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nInvoice Line Net Amount\n\nSum of Invoice Line Net Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Taxable Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nSubtotal GST Category Rate\n\nTotal GST Amount\n\nTotal Invoice Amount without GST\n\nTotal Invoice Amount with GST\n\nItem GST Category Code\n\nSubtotal GST Category Code\n\nMDEs present in Credit Note\n\nCustomization ID\n\nUnit\n\nProfile ID\n\nQuantity\n\nDoc UUID\n\nCredit Note Number\n\nCredit Note Currency Code\n\nCredit Note Line Identifier\n\nCredit Note Date\n\nItem Net Price\n\nItem GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Taxable Amount\n\nCredit Note Line Net Amount\n\nSum of Credit Note Line Net Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Rate\n\nTotal GST Amount\n\nTotal Credit Note Amount without GST\n\nTotal Credit Note Amount with GST\n\nAmount due for Payment\n\nInvoice Type Code (i.e., invoice or credit note)\n\nItem Name\n\nItem GST Category Code\n\nSubtotal GST Category Rate\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nTo enable businesses to better understand how the MDEs are to be filled for the different types of invoice data to be transmitted, we have provided examples for common invoicing scenarios in the Annexes for reference:\n\nSupplies Transactions (Refer to Annex A)\n\n(a) Peppol invoices (under Type 1A Submission)\n\n(b) Solution-extracted invoices (under Type 2 Submission)\n\n(c) Aggregated POS or STI transactions (under Type 2 Submission)\n\nPurchase Transactions (Refer to Annex B)\n\n(d) Solution-extracted invoices (under Type 1B or Type 2 Submission)\n\n(e) Aggregated PCP transactions (under Type 2 Submission)\n\nCredit Notes (Refer to Annex C)\n\n(f) Credit notes issued by business (under Type 1A or Type 2 Submission)\n\n(g) Credit notes received by business (under Type 1B or Type 3 Submission)\n\nCustomer’s UEN Information\n\nBusinesses would need to collect their customer’s information, e.g. Customer UEN (i.e. customer’s business registration number), Customer Name and Customer Address, which are mandatory data elements for submission to IRAS. If the customers are individuals, businesses can indicate “NA” in both the Customer Name and Customer UEN fields. When indicating the details of overseas customers, businesses must indicate the customer’s overseas business registration number. Businesses must maintain supporting documents to substantiate the customer information as part of their recording keeping.\n\nPeppol Invoices Issued Without the Words “Tax Invoice”\n\nAlthough Peppol invoices issued by the supplier (under Type 1A Submission) and received by the customer (under Type 1B Submission) under the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution do not contain the words “Tax Invoice”, IRAS is prepared to accept the invoices as valid tax invoices which businesses may use to support their GST input tax claims. This is on the condition that all the other contents required on a tax invoice, as specified under Regulation 11 of the GST (General) Regulations are present. Any input tax claims by the business will also be subject to the normal input tax claiming conditions for GST.\n\nOn the other hand, for all other invoice data submitted to IRAS (i.e. under Type 2 and 3 Submission), the underlying invoices issued and received remain as the source document. In this regard, the words “Tax Invoice” must be shown on the underlying invoices in order for the supplier to fulfil Regulation 11 of the GST (General) Regulations, and for the customer to fulfil the normal input tax claiming conditions. When transmitting such solution-extracted invoices to IRAS, businesses need not indicate the words “Tax Invoice” on the invoices.\n\nValidation Checks\n\nData Schema Validation Check\n\nIRSPs and GST-registered businesses submitting invoice data to IRAS must implement a data schema validation check to ensure that the data entered is compliant with the mandatory data elements. Schematron files are available for IRSPs and GST-registered businesses to use to validate their invoice data submissions and ensure they conform with the regular XML structure.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, IRAS has not imposed any validation check between the invoice level amounts and the line level amounts on invoices. This is because solutions used by businesses may handle rounding differences on invoices differently. For example, some solutions may round the amounts at the line level, while others may round the amounts at the invoice level.\n\nPlease speak to your IRSPs or APs or your in-house enterprise solution providers to facilitate the development of your solution.\n\nValidation Check on Wrongful GST Charges\n\nIRSPs and GST-registered businesses are recommended to build the validation check on wrongful GST charges feature in their InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. This check utilises invoice data such as the Supplier GSTN, Invoice Date and GST Amount and data returned from the IRAS’ Check GST Register API to detect invoices that wrongly charge GST.\n\nImplementing this validation check will ease tax compliance, and give businesses the assurance that the GST charges are legitimate. For more information, please speak to your AP or IRSP to find out how they can support you in this work.\n\nInvoicing Guidance for Common GST Scenarios\n\nIssuing Credit Notes\n\nA GST-registered business may issue a credit note to adjust the taxable value and GST amount in the original invoices previously issued and submitted to IRAS (e.g. over-billings, incorrectly zero-rated a transaction that cannot qualify for zero-rating). Invoice data relating to credit notes is to be sent to IRAS under the GST InvoiceNow Requirement.\n\nExample 14\n\nCompany P makes a local supply of customised tools and heavy machinery to Company Q. As Company Q is not on the InvoiceNow network, Company P issues a sales invoice in PDF to Company Q and submits the supply invoice data to IRAS under Type 2 submission.\n\nSubsequently, Company Q returned the customised tools to Company P due to poor workmanship, and Company P agreed to provide a full refund.\n\nAs the monetary value of the supply has changed, Company P must issue a credit note to Company Q, and submit the credit note data to IRAS under Type 2 submission.\n\nIn the case of adjustment to a standard-rated supply, if both the supplier and customer choose not to adjust the GST amount charged on the original invoices in the credit note and fulfil the conditions for doing so, the supplier may do so and submit the credit note data to IRAS accordingly. The supplier should continue to apply GST Category Code “SR”, even if the GST amounts are not adjusted.\n\nIf the supplier wishes to cancel an invoice, the business may issue a credit note to do so. To cancel the invoice, the amounts and GST category codes on the credit note would need to tally with the MDEs of the original invoice.\n\nWhen issuing or recording the credit note, the business must ensure that all the required MDEs of a credit note are filled. The business should, where possible, indicate the number and date of the original invoice in the following MDE fields Preceding Invoice Number (IBT-025) and Preceding Invoice Date (IBT-026) when submitting credit note data to IRAS. If the business is unable to identify the original invoice, these fields may be left blank. However, it must maintain documentary evidence that it has accounted for GST on the original supply.\n\nReceiving Credit Notes\n\nBesides issuing credit notes, a GST-registered business may, in the course of business, receive credit notes from its supplier as well. The business will need to receive, validate and accept the invoice in its solution. This would include indicating the appropriate purchase GST category code(s), taxable purchase amount and input tax amount that the customer wishes to claim.\n\nPlease refer to Annex C for illustrations on how the data elements are to be populated for credit notes issued or received for submission to IRAS.\n\nMaking Resubmissions to IRAS\n\nAfter the invoice has been issued and submitted to IRAS, a GST-registered business may at times need to perform adjustments that do not affect the monetary values on the invoice (e.g. updating the Invoice Note, change in GST category code from ZR to ES33 etc.) recorded in its InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. For such transactions, the business will have to send the revised invoice to IRAS using the same Document UUID contained in the original invoice, which is part of the functionality within InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions. Please speak to your IRSP or AP on how the resubmission process works within your InvoiceNow-Ready Solution.\n\nIRAS will regard the last invoice or credit note submitted by the business to be the latest submission and use that record for tax administration purposes.\n\nWhere the adjustments are made via the issuance of a credit note, such adjustments would not constitute a resubmission.\n\nExample 16\n\nCompany T makes a local supply to Company U. As both companies are on the InvoiceNow network, Company T issues an invoice to Company U through the InvoiceNow network and submits the supply invoice data to IRAS under Type 1A submission.\n\nSubsequently, Company U notices that the goods delivery address indicated on the invoice is incorrect, and requests Company T to revise and resend the invoice to Company U.\n\nAs there is no change to the monetary value of the supply, Company T may amend and send the revised invoice (using the Document UUID of the original invoice) to Company U through the InvoiceNow network. Company T may do so by performing a resubmission of the supply invoice data to IRAS under Type 1A submission.\n\nIf Company U has not processed and submitted the incorrect invoice as purchase invoice data to IRAS under Type 1B submission, Company U may simply submit the revised invoice as purchase invoice data to IRAS under Type 1B submission. Otherwise, Company U may need to resubmit both the original invoice and the revised invoice as purchase invoice data to IRAS under Type 1B submission.\n\nErrors made in Processing Solution-extracted Invoices\n\nWhere there are errors in the solution-extracted invoices processed after the data has been submitted to IRAS (e.g. typographical errors in the invoice value), businesses will have to send the revised invoice to IRAS using the same Document UUID contained in the original invoice.\n\nExample 17\n\nWhen processing an invoice from a supplier, Company V wrongly entered and submitted a purchase invoice data of S$100 to IRAS.\n\nTo rectify this mistake, Company V amends the GST amount of the supplier’s invoice that was previously recorded in the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. As amendment is made to the invoice data submitted to IRAS previously, Company V needs to resubmit the invoice data to IRAS using the same Document UUID of the original invoice.\n\nExample 18\n\nCompany W incorrectly keyed in the GST category code of “TX” instead of “ZP” when processing a zero-rated purchase invoice and submitted the invoice data to IRAS.\n\nTo rectify this mistake, Company W amends the GST category code of the zero-rated purchase invoice recorded in the InvoiceNow-Ready Solution. As the amendment is made to the invoice data submitted to IRAS previously, Company W needs to resubmit the invoice data to IRAS using the same Document UUID of the original invoice.\n\nIssuing Invoices in Foreign Currency\n\nA GST-registered business may issue invoices denominated in foreign currency. When doing so, certain non-mandatory data elements such as Tax currency code, Invoice total without GST in tax currency (SGD), Invoice total with GST in tax currency (SGD), Total GST amount in tax currency (SGD) should also be filled in.\n\nExample 19\n\nCompany X makes a local sale of goods to an overseas company amounting to US$1,000 (or S$1,350), with GST charged.\n\nIn the supplies invoice data to be submitted to IRAS, Company X should indicate the following:\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission) or Solution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nInvoice Currency Code\n\nTax Currency Code\n\nTotal Amount without GST\n\nCurrency ID for Invoice Total Amount without GST\n\nTotal GST Amount in invoice currency\n\nCurrency ID for Total GST Amount\n\nTotal Amount with GST\n\nCurrency ID for Total Amount with GST\n\nAmount due for payment\n\nCurrency ID for Amount due for payment\n\nThe business does not need to provide the exchange rate in the invoice but it must use the approved exchange rates specified in the e-Tax Guide “Exchange Rates for GST Purpose” to convert the foreign currency to SGD.\n\nInvoice Submissions with Multiple Line Items involving a mix of Taxable and Non-Taxable Transactions\n\nA GST-registered business may at times issue invoices with multiple line items with different GST treatments and GST category codes. Such invoice data may be submitted to IRAS as a single invoice.\n\nExample 20\n\nCompany Y makes the following sales of goods to the customer:\n\nDescription\n\n5 hats, delivered locally\n8 shirts, delivered locally\n10 pairs of shoes, exported from Singapore to overseas\n\nGST category code\n\nSR\nSR\nZR\n\nTotal value of goods (before GST, if applicable)\n\nS$100\nS$200\nS$400\n\nCompany Y may issue and submit the supply invoice data as a single tax invoice to IRAS.\n\nIn the supply invoice data submission, Company Y may indicate the following information accordingly at the line-item, subtotal and total levels:\n\nAt the line-item level\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission) or Solution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nInvoice Line Identifier\n\nQuantity\n\nUnit\n\nInvoice Line Net Amount\n\nCurrency ID for Invoice Line Net Amount\n\nItem Name\n\nItem GST Category Code\n\nItem GST Category Rate\n\nItem GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nItem Net Price\n\nFor the hats\n\n1\n5\nPC\n100.00\nSGD\n\nFor the shirts\n\n2\n8\nPC\n200.00\nSGD\n\nFor the shoes\n\n3\n10\nPC\n400.00\nSGD\n\nAt the subtotal level\n\nRelevant Business Terms\n\nSubtotal GST Category Taxable Amount\n\nCurrency ID for Subtotal GST Category Taxable Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Amount\n\nCurrency ID for Subtotal GST Category Tax Amount\n\nSubtotal GST Category Code\n\nSubtotal GST Category Tax Scheme ID\n\nSubtotal GST Category Rate\n\nFor all standard-rated supplies\n\n300.00\nSGD\n\n27.00\nSGD\n\nSR\nGST\n9\n\nFor all zero-rated supplies\n\n400.00\nSGD\n\n0.00\nSGD\n\nZR\nGST\n0\n\nAt the total level\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nTotal Amount without GST\n\nCurrency ID for Invoice Total Amount without GST\n\nTotal GST Amount\n\nCurrency ID for Total GST Amount\n\nTotal Amount with GST\n\nCurrency ID for Total Amount with GST\n\nAmount due for payment\n\nCurrency ID for Amount due for payment\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission) or Solution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\n700.00\nSGD\n\n27.00\nSGD\n\n727.00\nSGD\n\n727.00\nSGD\n\nGST Invoicing Requirements for Different Groups of Businesses\n\nThe table below provides guidance on how different groups of GST-registered businesses should complete the Sender ID, Supplier ID and Supplier GSTN fields when issuing invoices.\n\nScenarios\n\nGST invoicing requirements\n\nGuidance to fill in the invoice/credit note MDEs\n\nEntity is a company\n\nThe company should reflect its GSTN on invoices that it issues to charge and account for GST on taxable supplies that it makes.\n\n• Sender ID (from SBDH envelope): To use the Peppol ID registered under the UEN of the company.\n\n• Supplier ID (IBT-030): To indicate the UEN of the company.

Company BB is required to apply customer accounting on this sale to Company CC.\n\nCompany BB is required to submit to IRAS the invoice data of the customer accounting tax invoice issued to Company CC, based on the MDEs in the sample illustration in Annex A, and taking into account the following:\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nIBT-022\n\nName of MDE\n\nInvoice Note\n\nSale made under customer accounting. Customer is to account for GST of S$945.\n\nIBT-118\n\nSubtotal GST Category Code\n\nSRCA-S\n\nIBT-109\n\nTotal Amount without GST\n\n10,500.00\n\nIBT-110\n\nTotal GST Amount\n\n0.00\n\nIBT-112\n\nTotal Amount with GST\n\n10,500.00\n\nCompany CC is required to submit to IRAS the invoice data of the customer accounting tax invoice received from Company BB based on the MDEs in the sample illustration in Annex B, and taking into account the following:\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nIBT-022\n\nName of MDE\n\nInvoice Note\n\nSale made under customer accounting. Customer is to account for GST of S$945.\n\nIBT-118\n\nSubtotal GST Category Code\n\nTXCA\n\nIBT-109\n\nTotal Amount without GST\n\n10,500.00\n\nIBT-110\n\nTotal GST Amount\n\n945.00\n\nIBT-112\n\nTotal Amount with GST\n\n11,445.00\n\nCompany CC must still account for the output tax according to the prevailing customer accounting rules and may claim the input tax in its GST returns according to the general input tax claiming rules.\n\nOther Administrative Matters\n\nData Reconciliation between the Invoice Data Submitted to IRAS and Figures Reported in the GST return\n\nBusinesses should do their due diligence to ensure that the invoice data submitted tally with what they submit in their GST returns. However, IRAS recognises that legitimate differences could arise due to reasons such as:\n\n(a) Timing differences – e.g. where time of supplied is triggered by payment, and invoices are issued after the filing of GST return; supplies straddling GST registration, etc.\n\n(b) Supplies where invoices are not required – e.g. deemed supplies and Reverse Charge\n\n(c) Purchases where input tax are not claimed or not claimed in full, e.g. input tax subject to attribution or apportionment\n\n(d) Correcting errors in F5 instead of filing F7\n\nBusinesses will not be penalised so long as they adhere to the record keeping requirements and are able to produce these records upon request to substantiate their GST reporting and invoice data submissions.\n\nImplications to GST Group Registration\n\nA new voluntary GST registrant may apply to be included into an existing GST group. If the new voluntary GST-registered entity is included into an existing GST group once it is GST-registered, the entire GST group will be subjected to the GST InvoiceNow Requirement at a later phase, to be announced in future.\n\nExample 23\n\nOn 1 Apr 2026, Company DD intends to apply for voluntary GST registration and to join its parent company under an existing GST group registration.\n\nIn this case, Company DD will be subject to GST InvoiceNow Requirement at a later phase, based on the timeline for the entire GST group, which will be announced in the future.\n\nWhen sending invoice data to IRAS, the GST group can either transmit invoice data separately (as individual members of the group), or on a consolidated basis (by the representative member of the GST group).\n\nThere could be instances where a GST group consists of an Excluded Business as a group member. In such cases, the invoice data of the Excluded Business need not be transmitted to IRAS under the requirement. The GST group may also choose to submit all invoice data to IRAS, including invoice data belonging to the Excluded Business, if doing so eases their compliance burden.\n\nEven if the invoice data is transmitted by each individual member, there is no change to the GST reporting requirement for entities under the GST group, i.e. the GST group will continue to report their GST return on a consolidated basis.\n\nImplications to Partially Exempt Businesses\n\nLike any other GST-registered businesses, partially exempt businesses are required to submit invoice data on purchases with input tax claims to IRAS.\n\nHowever, partially exempt businesses that fail the De Minimis rule are required to perform input tax attribution and apportionment, and they may satisfy the De Minimis Rule in some accounting periods and not in others. As such, these businesses may only be able to determine the actual input tax that are claimable at the end of each accounting period and tax year for longer period adjustments (where applicable).\n\nTo ease compliance, such partially exempt businesses may opt to submit all their purchase invoice data as part of the GST InvoiceNow Requirement, whether or not the input tax is claimed (partially or in full) and reported in the GST return. The businesses are not required to make any retrospective adjustments to the purchase invoice data at the end of the accounting period (or for longer period adjustments) based on the actual input tax claims submitted in the GST return.\n\nAPI Service Interruption\n\nIn the event that there is an API service interruption (e.g. when API call is interrupted in-transit, or when you receive no response or experience unexpected error while processing the submission), the InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions are designed with an exponential backoff retry approach to automatically perform the submission retries. Businesses may approach their APs or IRSPs for more information about the exponential backoff retry approach.\n\nIf businesses are not able to make the submission after performing several rounds of retries, they will have to submit their invoice data when the API service resumes. Businesses will be given sufficient time to make the submission.\n\nDuring the API service interruption, businesses can continue to transact with their customers and suppliers via the InvoiceNow network or outside the network, as this process is independent from the submission process to IRAS.\n\nBusinesses are also encouraged to put in place sufficient measures in their business continuity plans to cater for any unforeseen circumstances and activate them accordingly when the need arises.\n\nPreparing Early to Adopt GST InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions\n\nBusinesses are encouraged to come onboard early and plan ahead for the adoption of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions or make changes to their in-house enterprise solutions to be compatible with the GST InvoiceNow Requirement by taking the steps listed below.\n\nBetween Now to Apr 2025:\n\nStep 1: Ensure that your solution is InvoiceNow-Ready\n\nBusinesses with existing accounting or finance solutions, or businesses that are planning to purchase one, can check whether their preferred solution is listed on IMDA’s accredited InvoiceNow-Ready Solution Providers (“IRSPs”) list. They may also consider adopting free solutions with basic InvoiceNow capabilities.\n\nLarge enterprises using their own in-house solutions may get in touch with an IMDA-accredited Access Point Provider to get connected to the InvoiceNow network.\n\nStep 2: Register for InvoiceNow and obtain a Peppol ID\n\nBusinesses may approach their IRSP or AP to register themselves in the SG Peppol Directory with their UEN and obtain a Peppol ID.\n\nFrom May 2025 onwards:\n\nStep 3: Ensure that your business can transmit invoice data successfully to IRAS\n\nBusinesses may enable the GST InvoiceNow Submission feature and test their system.\n\nTypes of InvoiceNow-Ready Solutions\n\nOff-the-shelf accounting and finance solutions that are integrated with InvoiceNow capabilities to ensure that the business can successfully transmit invoices directly from its InvoiceNow-Ready solution to IRAS.\n\nContact the IRSP if you need assistance on how to do so.\n\nIn-house enterprise solutions\n\nContact the AP to ensure that the solution is connected to IRAS via API and that the GST InvoiceNow Submission feature is enabled.\n\nTest the invoice data transmission to IRAS with the AP, ensuring that the business receives transaction reports from the AP notifying if the invoice data submission is successful.\n\nBusinesses should allow 3 to 12 months for system connection and testing.\n\nContact Information\n\nFor enquiries on this e-Tax Guide, please contact the Goods and Service Tax Division at www.iras.gov.sg (select “Contact Us”).\n\nAnnex A – Sample Examples of Supplies Invoice Submissions\n\nFor detailed explanation on the MDEs, you may refer to Invoice Data Submission API Interface Specs on the GST InvoiceNow Requirement available at APEX portal. We strongly advise you to reach out to your AP and/or IRSP. You may work with your AP or IRSP to auto-populate the values for applicable MDEs.\n\nNotes:\n\n• For submission of aggregated invoice data for supplies (i.e. aggregated POS or STI transactions), businesses are to indicate “POS” or “STI” (as the case may be) for certain MDEs when recording the aggregated invoice data in the InvoiceNow solution for the transmission to IRAS.\n\nBusiness Term ID\n\nName of MDE\n\nPeppol invoice (Type 1A submission)\n\nSolution-extracted invoice (Type 2 submission)\n\nAggregated POS or STI transactions (Type 2 submission)\n\nIBT-024\n\nCustomization ID\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\n(Auto-populated by software)\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#conformant# urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:international:sg:3.0\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#conformant# urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:LocalTaxInvoice:sg:1.0\n\nFor SG Peppol BIS: urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#conformant# urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:LocalTaxInvoice:sg:1.0\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:pint:billing-1@sg-1\n\nFor PINT SG: urn:peppol:pint:billing-1@sg-1:LocalTaxInvoice:sg:1.0\n\nFor",

This requirement applies to MNEs with consolidated group revenue of at least S$1.125 billion in the previous financial year. MNEs must file a CbC report with the tax authority in the jurisdiction of the ultimate parent entity, which will share the report with other jurisdictions where the MNE operates. The report must be submitted within 12 months from the end of the reporting financial year. Non-compliance with CbCR requirements may lead to penalties, including fines and enforcement actions. For more information, contact the International Tax Division at the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. Singapore-headquartered MNE groups must prepare and file CbC Reports to IRAS for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, within 12 months from the end of their financial year. From financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, these groups must also notify IRAS of their obligation to file a CbC Report within 3 months from the end of the relevant financial year. The CbC Report includes information on the global allocation of income and taxes paid in different jurisdictions and other financial data. CbC Reports submitted to IRAS will be shared with tax authorities of jurisdictions with which Singapore has agreements for the automatic exchange of CbCR information.

The ruling applies only to the applicant and the specific arrangement mentioned in the request, binding the Comptroller to the interpretation provided. However, under certain circumstances, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) may decline to issue a ruling, such as if the matter involves foreign law interpretation or if the application is deemed frivolous. The application process involves several steps, including submitting a detailed application form and paying a non-refundable fee. If accepted, the ruling is generally issued within eight weeks.

You can use the Exchange Rate Search Function to retrieve the average exchange rate and convert foreign currency amounts to Singapore dollars for YA 2021 onwards.', 'urls': ['https://www.mas.gov.sg/', 'https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/xlsx/exchange-rate-search-function.xlsx?sfvrsn=47c95ed9_19']}",

Year of Assessment and Basis Period\n\nIncome is assessed to tax on a preceding year basis. The basis period for a Year of Assessment (YA) is the financial year ending in the year preceding that YA. The examples below illustrate the concept of YA and basis period:\n\na) If your financial year end is 31 Mar of each year, the basis period for YA 2023 is 1 Apr 2021 to 31 Mar 2022.\n\nb) If your financial year end is 31 Dec of each year, the basis period for YA 2023 is 1 Jan 2022 to 31 Dec 2022.\n\n2 Total Dividends\n\nThe amount to be entered is the total dividends, including Singapore exempt dividends, foreign dividends not remitted to Singapore and foreign dividends that qualify for tax exemption. For details on tax exemption for foreign-sourced dividends, please refer to our e-Tax Guide “Tax Exemption for Foreign-Sourced Income\".\n\n3 Other Income\n\nThese may include payouts (such as Wage Credit Scheme, Jobs Growth Incentive and Job Supports Scheme), royalties and other foreign-sourced income not remitted to Singapore. \n\n4 Dividends from Other Countries/ Territories\n\nEnter the taxable amount only. Do not include foreign dividends not remitted to Singapore and foreign dividends that qualify for tax exemption.\n\n5 Other Allowable Expenses\n\nThese include directors’ fees, staff salaries, approved provident fund contributions, office rental, office utilities charges, general expenses, administrative and management expenses.\n\nAs a guide, the total amount of these expenses should not exceed 5% of the company's gross investment income.\n\n6 Direct Expenses \n\nThese are revenue expenses directly incurred to earn the income. Only amount(s) attributable to income-producing investments are allowed.\n\n7 Supporting Schedules\n\nAttach supporting schedules showing your basis of arriving at the other allowable expenses and direct expenses.\n\n8 Share of Common Expenses\n\nThe common expenses are to be apportioned in the following manner:\n\nInvestment Income x Total common expenses\n\nTotal Income\n\nE.g. Share of common expenses attributable to foreign dividend income:\n\nForeign Dividend x Total common expenses \n\nTotal income \n\n9 Approved Donations\n\nFor donations made to approved Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) and other approved recipients, 2.5 times the amount of donations made will be given as a deduction.\n\nSubject to the shareholding test, unutilised donations can be carried forward to offset against income of the company for subsequent years, up to a maximum of 5 years. For example, if the company as at the end of YA 2022 has remaining unutilised donations brought forward from YA 2017, these should be disregarded and not carried forward to YA 2023.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the relevant tax authority's website.\n\n10 Partial Tax Exemption\n\nFrom YA 2020, partial tax exemption is given on chargeable income of up to $200,000 as follows:\nChargeable income \nFirst $10,000        \nNext $190,000        \nTotal $200,000 \n\nAmount exempted from tax \n\n@ 75% \n@ 50%  \n\nFor more information, please refer to the relevant tax authority's website.\n\n11 Tax Exemption for New Start-up Companies\n\nAn investment holding company is not eligible to claim the tax exemption for new start-up companies. The company will still enjoy the partial tax exemption. \n\n12 Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)\n\nAmount allowable is the lower of the Singapore tax payable on the net foreign income or the foreign tax paid.\n\nUnder the FTC pooling system, the amount of FTC allowable is to be restricted to the lower of total Singapore tax payable on the foreign income under pooling and the pooled foreign taxes paid on those income.\n\nFTC is not applicable for foreign-sourced dividends that are treated as exempt income in Singapore.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the relevant tax authority's website.\n\n13 Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rebate\n\nYA 2019: 20% CIT rebate (capped at $10,000)\n\nYA 2020: 25% CIT rebate (capped at $15,000)\n\nFor more information, please refer to the relevant tax authority's website.\n\nMore information on preparing tax computation for an investment holding company is available on the relevant tax authority's website.",

                "processed_text": "Explanatory Notes to Basic Format of Tax Computation for a Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) Company\n\nThis explanatory note mainly covers items specific to DEI companies.\n\nDEI Income  \nThis refers to the income derived from qualifying activities stated in the DEI certificate.\n\nNon-DEI Income  \nThis refers to the income other than DEI income.\n\nTax Rate  \nConcessionary Tax Rate  \nThis refers to the reduced tax rate stated in the DEI certificate. The amount of DEI income in excess of the base income is taxed at a concessionary tax rate stipulated in the DEI certificate.\n\nNormal Tax Rate  \nThis refers to the prevailing corporate tax rate for the relevant year of assessment.\n\nFunctional Currency  \nFunctional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.\n\nA company is required to prepare its accounts and tax computation in its functional currency. Where a company's functional currency is in non-Singapore dollar (non-S$), all items in the tax computation up to the chargeable income after exempt amount should be in their non-S$ functional currency. Please refer to the IRAS circular \"Filing of Income Tax Computations and Financial Statements in Functional Currencies Other Than Singapore Dollars.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the above, companies are required to complete the Income Tax Return (Form C) and its appendices in S$. Companies need to translate the relevant items required for the Form C and Appendices into S$ equivalent amounts, using the average exchange rate.\n\nDirect Expenses  \nThe expenses which are incurred solely to derive the qualifying income or non-qualifying income.\n\nDirect Identification of Revenue and Direct Expenses  \nAll revenue and direct expense for qualifying and non-qualifying activities must be identified and reported separately under each tax category. The company must ensure that there are adequate underlying controls in its accounting and reporting system for the purpose of recording and reporting its income correctly under each tax category.\n\nCommon Expenses  \nThe expenses which are incurred to derive both qualifying income and non-qualifying income. Please refer to note 9 for basis of apportioning the common expenses.\n\nCommon Assets  \nCommon assets are assets used by the company for its trade or business to generate both qualifying and non-qualifying income. Please refer to note 9 for basis of apportioning the capital allowances for common assets.\n\nBasis of Apportionment of Common Expenses and Capital Allowances for Common Assets  \nAll common expenses and capital allowances for common assets must be apportioned to each tax category using an appropriate basis that must:\n\nBear nexus to business activities and reasonably reflect the level of activities under the different tax categories.  \nBe applied consistently across the YAs provided that there is no change in the business or operating circumstances.\n\nAs a guide, we have used company's turnover as a basis of apportioning the common expenses and capital allowance for common assets in the \"Common Expenses\" and \"Common Assets\" schedules. Companies can use other basis of apportionment if the basis used can satisfy the above conditions.\n\nIf both DEI and non-DEI income are of similar nature (e.g., both income are derived from sales of goods manufactured by the company, or from trading of goods or from the provision of similar services), the turnover basis is a commonly acceptable basis for apportioning common expenses/capital allowances from common assets. (Turnover refers to revenue from Section 10(1)(a) trade sources only, that is, they exclude passive and non-trade income such as capital receipts, interest income etc.)\n\nIf the DEI and non-DEI income are of different nature, the turnover basis may not be appropriate. In this case, you can use a more appropriate basis such as gross profit margin/cost of sale/floor area/head count which is more reflective of the level of business activities under the DEI and non-DEI tax categories.\n\nComplete the schedule on “Common Expenses” and “CA (Common Assets)” to apportion the total common expenses, total disallowable common expense and total capital allowance for common assets to the respective DEI and non-DEI tax category. Then fill in the apportioned amount in the P&L Account (total common expenses) and Main Tax Computation (total disallowable common expenses and capital allowances for common assets) under the DEI and non-DEI tax categories respectively.\n\nMedical Expenses  \nThe excess medical expense exceeding the specified percentage of total employee remuneration is to be taxed at prevailing corporate tax rate, i.e., the amount is to be included under non-DEI tax category in the main tax computation.\n\nBase Income  \nThis refers to the average corresponding income stated in the DEI certificate. The base income is subject to tax at prevailing corporate tax rate.\n\nEnter base income amount (as stated in DEI certificate) or sub-total (before base income), whichever is lower, under \"DEI\" column (to be deducted from DEI sub-total) and enter the same amount under \"Non-DEI\" column (to add to non-DEI sub-total so as to tax at prevailing corporate tax rate).\n\nIf the DEI tax category is in a loss position (sub-total before base income is negative), base income is not applicable.\n\nFill in the following Base Income amount (Q) in Main Tax Computation:  \nIf (P) under the DEI tax category ≤ 0, (Q) = 0  \nIf (P) under the DEI tax category > 0 and < base income stated in DEI cert, then (Q) = (P)  \nIf (P) under the DEI tax category > 0 and > base income stated in DEI cert, then (Q) = base income stated in DEI certificate\n\nSection 37B Adjustment  \nWhere there is any unabsorbed capital allowances, losses or donations in respect of income that is taxed at one rate, the amounts will be set off against income taxed at another rate after applying an adjustment factor.\n\nWhere DEI and non-DEI tax categories are both in profit position or both are in loss position (Sub-total before S37B Adjustment for both tax categories are negative or both sub-totals are positive), Section 37B adjustment is not applicable as there are no losses at one tax rate to be set off against profit at another tax rate.\n\nPlease refer to the examples below on how to compute Section 37B adjustments. For the purpose of illustration, assume that the concessionary tax rate under DEI is 10% and the prevailing corporate tax rate is 17%.\n\nExample 1  \nDEI = profit, non-DEI = loss\n\nExample 1A  \nSet-off full non-DEI loss against DEI profit  \nTax Rate  \nAmount before S37B set-off [item (T)]  \nAdd/(Less): S37B adjustments *  \nAmount after S37B set-off  \n\n* 10,000 X 17/10 = 17,000  \n\nExample 1B  \nDEI ($)   Non-DEI ($)  \n17%  \n(10,000)  \n10,000  \n0  \n\n10%  \n50,000  \n(17,000)  \n33,000  \n\nSet-off part of non-DEI loss against DEI profit (insufficient DEI profit to absorb full non-DEI loss)  \nTax Rate  \nAmount before S37B set-off [item (T)]  \nAdd/(Less): S37B adjustments *  \nAmount after S37B set-off  \n\n* 17,000 X 10/17 = 10,000  \n\nExample 2  \nDEI = loss, non-DEI = profit\n\nExample 2A  \nSet-off full DEI loss against non-DEI profit  \nTax Rate  \nAmount before S37B set-off [item (T)]  \nAdd/(Less): S37B adjustments *  \nAmount after S37B set-off  \n\nDEI ($)   Non-DEI ($)  \n17%  \n(50,000)  \n10,000  \n(40,000)  \n\n10%  \n17,000  \n(17,000)  \n0  \n\nDEI ($)   Non-DEI ($)  \n17%  \n50,000  \n(5,882)  \n44,118  \n\n10%  \n(10,000)  \n10,000  \n0  \n\n* 10,000 X 10/17 = 5,882  \n\nExample 2B  \nSet-off part of DEI loss against non-DEI profit (insufficient non-DEI profit to absorb full DEI loss)  \nTax Rate  \nAmount before S37B set-off [item (T)]  \nAdd/(Less): S37B adjustments *  \nAmount after S37B set-off  \n\n* 5,882 X 17/10 = 10,000  \n\nDEI ($)   Non-DEI ($)  \n17%  \n5,882  \n(5,882)  \n0  \n\n10%  \n(50,000)  \n10,000  \n(40,000)  \n\nAverage Exchange Rate  \nThis refers to the average of the exchange rates of the accounting period that constitutes the basis period for that year of assessment.\n\nThis is computed using the aggregate of the end of each month's exchange rate for the accounting period divided by the number of months in that accounting period. The end of month exchange rates for the more commonly used foreign currencies are available at the Monetary Authority of Singapore website.",

                "processed_text": "Filing of Income Tax Computations in Functional Currencies other than Singapore Dollars (Second Edition)\n\nThis e-Tax Guide explains the rules for filing income tax computations in non-S$ currencies. It applies to businesses that prepare their financial statements in non-S$ functional currencies.\n\nFor accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2003, companies are required to prepare their financial statements in their functional currencies, which may be non-S$. Sole proprietorships and partnerships may also choose to prepare their financial statements in non-S$ functional currencies.\n\nWhere a company, sole proprietorship, or a partnership prepares its financial statements in a non-S$ functional currency, its tax computation should also be prepared in the same functional currency. This applies to all items within the tax computation up to the chargeable income for a company, distributable profit/loss/other income as well as the capital allowances claimed for a partnership, and adjusted profit/loss (but before any loss brought forward) and the capital allowances claimed for a sole proprietorship. These three items will then be converted into S$ at the average rate for the relevant Year of Assessment.\n\nIf a business shifts from S$ to a non-S$ currency as its functional currency, it would have to translate its existing S$ balances into the non-S$ functional currencies. Such businesses can opt to use either the changeover rate or average rate method for the purpose of translating the existing S$ balances. The business has to elect its choice of method when the tax computation is first submitted in non-S$ functional currencies, and such election is irrevocable.\n\nBusinesses include companies, sole proprietorships, and partnerships. Capital allowances claimed by a business under section 16, 17, 18B, 18C, 19, 19A, 19B, 19C, 19D, or 20 of the Income Tax Act 1947 for a Year of Assessment are referred to as capital allowances. Unabsorbed capital allowances, trade losses, and donations for the current year are collectively referred to as current year loss items. Existing companies are those that have submitted income tax computations in S$ prior to the relevant first Year of Assessment. Existing S$ balances refer to unabsorbed tax items, tax written down value of existing assets, cost of the assets granted capital allowances that have yet to be disposed of, and prior year income/expense items. The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which a business operates. Newly incorporated companies refer to companies that prepare their financial statements in non-S$ functional currency since incorporation. Prior year income/expense items are S$ items derived/incurred and included in prior year tax computations but were taxable/allowable only in a subsequent Year of Assessment when the financial statements are prepared in non-S$ functional currency. Tax written down value refers to the cost of an asset that has not yet been given tax relief by way of capital allowances. The relevant first Year of Assessment is the first Year of Assessment when a business prepares its income tax computation in its non-S$ functional currency. Unabsorbed tax items refer to any unabsorbed capital allowances, trade losses (which include any unabsorbed further deduction), donations, and investment allowances.\n\nFor accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2003, the Company Act 1967 requires companies to comply with the Financial Reporting Standards of Singapore and the Interpretations of FRS. The FRS requires a company to determine its functional currency (which may be non-S$) and measure its results and financial position in that currency.\n\nConsequently, the Income Tax Act was amended to provide for the filing of income tax computations in the same non-S$ functional currency as that used for the financial statements. The earliest Year of Assessment for this change is Year of Assessment 2004 for a business with an accounting period beginning on 1 January 2003, and Year of Assessment 2005 for a business with an accounting period beginning after 1 January 2003.\n\nFor sole proprietorships and partnerships that have chosen to prepare their financial statements in non-S$ functional currencies, they should file their tax computations in the same non-S$ functional currencies. Such financial statements should continue to be certified true and correct by the sole proprietors or precedent partners.\n\nThe general rules for filing income tax computations in non-S$ functional currencies are as follows: For companies, all items in their tax computations up to the chargeable income (after applying the partial or full tax exemption, where applicable) should be in their non-S$ functional currencies; for partnerships, all items in their computations up to the distributable profit/loss/other income as well as the capital allowances claimed should be in their non-S$ functional currencies; and for sole proprietors, all items in their tax computations up to the adjusted profit/loss (but before any loss brought forward), as well as the capital allowances for that trade or business, should be in their non-S$ functional currencies.\n\nBusinesses have an irrevocable option of translating all the existing S$ balances into the non-S$ functional currency using the average of the exchange rates of the 12 months before the end of the last accounting period in which the financial statements are submitted in S$ - “changeover rate”; or the accounting period that constitutes the basis period for that Year of Assessment - “average rate”.\n\nFor example, if the company’s basis period for Year of Assessment 2021 is 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020, the relevant exchange rates to be used for the two options would be the average of the exchange rates from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 for the “changeover rate”; or the average of the exchange rates from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 for the “average rate”.\n\nThe rules below apply to existing companies and newly incorporated companies. Illustrations of income tax computations of existing companies using the changeover rate method and average rate method can be found in Annex A and Annex B respectively. An example of a newly incorporated company’s tax computation with non-S$ functional currency is provided in Annex C.\n\nThe existing S$ balances for existing companies should be translated into the non-S$ functional currencies using either the changeover rate method or the average rate method. Companies must make an irrevocable election to apply one method in the first Year of Assessment when they submit their tax return in their non-S$ functional currency.\n\nThe existing S$ balances of tax written down value of existing assets and prior year income/expenses translated into the non-S$ functional currency amounts should be used to compute the current year capital allowances and deduction in that non-S$ functional currency. Any unabsorbed non-S$ balances will be carried forward to subsequent Years of Assessment in the following ways: If the changeover rate method is used, such balances will be carried forward to subsequent Years of Assessment in the non-S$ functional currency; if the average rate method is used, such balances will be carried forward to the subsequent Year of Assessment in S$. This is done by translating the unabsorbed non-S$ balances into S$ amounts using the same average rate for that Year of Assessment. This translation cycle will continue until the existing S$ balances are fully utilized.\n\nAll other current year items of companies will be reflected in the companies’ tax computations in the non-S$ functional currencies as shown in the companies’ financial statements. Further tax deduction and investment allowance given based on current year expenditure will be shown in the companies’ tax computations in the non-S$ functional currencies. There is no need to translate these current year items.\n\nA sale of property between related parties may be eligible for an election under section 24 of the Income Tax Act. In this case, if the buyer and the seller have different functional currencies, the tax written down value of the property in the seller’s functional currency must be translated to the buyer’s functional currency. The translation is to be done using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the sale.\n\nA transfer of property without consideration as a result of business conversion may be eligible for an election under section 25 of the Income Tax Act. The transferor and transferee can elect for the transferee to claim allowances on the capital expenditure incurred by the transferor in respect of the property, which remained unallowed at the time of the transfer. If the transferor and transferee have different functional currencies, the tax written down value of the property in the transferor’s functional currency must be translated to the transferee’s functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transfer.\n\nCurrent year loss items that qualify for transfer under the group relief system will be transferred out based on the non-S$ functional currency of the transferor. Where the functional currency of the transferor is different from the claimant, the current year loss items will be translated into the claimant’s functional currency at the average rate.\n\nExchange gains/losses of a revenue nature might have been recognized in the companies’ accounts but were regarded as “unrealized” for tax purposes. These exchange gains/losses would have been excluded from the tax computation of the relevant Year of Assessment and would be treated as taxable/deductible only in a subsequent Year of Assessment when the gains/losses are realized or deemed realized for tax purposes.\n\nWith effect from Year of Assessment 2004, businesses have to align the tax treatment of foreign exchange gains/losses of a revenue nature with the accounting treatment unless an election was made to opt out of the tax treatment in Year of Assessment 2004. Any unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses of these businesses which have not been taxed or deducted before Year of Assessment 2004 would be deemed realized in Year of Assessment 2004.\n\nThese unrealized exchange gains/losses in S$ may be realized or deemed realized in a Year of Assessment where the reporting was in non-S$ functional currency. In this case, the gains/losses shall be translated to the non-S$ functional currency using the same exchange rate used for the purpose of translating the existing S$ balances.\n\nForeign exchange gains/losses arising from a change in functional currency are not taxable or deductible for income tax purposes.\n\nCompanies granted tax incentives under the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act 1967 may be subjected to a preferential tax rate on their income exceeding a specified amount. This amount in S$ should be translated into the non-S$ functional currency, using the average rate for the relevant Year of Assessment.\n\nAny tax exemption granted under sections of the Income Tax Act should be translated into the companies’ non-S$ functional currency using the average rate for the relevant Year of Assessment.\n\nTax payable by companies shall be in S$. This is computed by multiplying the companies’ chargeable income in their non-S$ functional currencies (after applying the partial or full tax exemption) with the corporate tax rate and translating the tax payable into S$ using the average rate.\n\nDouble taxation relief or unilateral tax credit is to be allowed at the lower of Singapore tax payable on the foreign sourced income (after allowable deductions under the Income Tax Act) or the foreign tax paid. The Singapore tax payable on the relevant foreign sourced income should be translated into S$ using the average rate of the same Year of Assessment.\n\nThe foreign tax paid in non-S$ functional currency (actual amount paid or as reflected in the financial statements) should be translated into S$ using the average rate of the same Year of Assessment.\n\nTax deducted at source in respect of Singapore interest from loan stocks or distributions from Real Estate Investment Trust will be allowed based on the actual S$ amount withheld by the payer company. The amount withheld should be shown on the Singapore dividend statements.\n\nResident companies that pay dividends in their non-S$ functional currencies must provide the S$ equivalent of the dividend paid in the dividend voucher/notification, where applicable. The non-S$ functional currencies should be translated into S$ equivalent amount using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment of each dividend.\n\nAny S$ interest received from loan stock where Singapore tax has been deducted at source should be translated into the company’s functional currency for the purposes of income tax filing. This translation is to be done using the average rate for the Year of Assessment concerned.\n\nWhere the dividend/interest is received in non-S$, the recipient has to translate the S$ equivalent of the dividend/interest, as stated in the dividend voucher/notification, where applicable, into its own non-S$ functional currency using the average rate. The translation has to be done even if the recipient and payer companies of the dividend/interest used the same non-S$ functional currency.\n\nA summary of the translation method for the respective tax items can be found in the document.\n\nFor partnerships whose financial statements are prepared in non-S$ functional currencies, all items up to the distributable profit/loss/other income as well as the capital allowances claimed should be in their non-S$ functional currencies. The rules applicable to companies will similarly apply to partnerships, except for those in relation to the transfer of loss items under the group relief system, income under tax incentives, partial or full tax exemption, and tax payable.\n\nThe precedent partner of the partnership must make an irrevocable election in writing, in the first tax return submitted in non-S$ functional currency. The election shall specify the method of translating the existing S$ balances. The amount of profit/loss/other income and capital allowances allocated to each partner will then be translated into S$ at the average rate for inclusion in the tax computation of each partner.\n\nAny loss and capital allowances that cannot be absorbed or fully absorbed by a partner will be carried forward to the next Year of Assessment or carried back to the preceding Year of Assessment in S$ in that individual partner’s tax computation.\n\nFor sole proprietors, all items in their tax computations up to the adjusted profit/loss (but before any loss brought forward) should be in their non-S$ functional currencies. Capital allowances for the trade or business should also be reflected in the non-S$ functional currencies.\n\nA sole proprietor should make an irrevocable election in writing on the method of translating any existing S$ balances. Such an election must be made in the first year when the sole proprietor submits the tax return and financial statements of the sole proprietorship in non-S$ functional currency.\n\nThe adjusted profit/loss, and capital allowances for the current year, as reflected in the non-S$ functional currency should be translated into S$ at the average rate. Unabsorbed losses brought forward in S$ from the previous Year of Assessment can then be set off against the current year adjusted profit that is translated into S$.\n\nIf the sole proprietorship incurs adjusted loss for the current year, such loss (and the capital allowances) for the Year of Assessment, as translated into S$, can be set off against other sources of income of the sole proprietor. Any loss and capital allowances that remain unabsorbed can be carried forward to the following Year of Assessment or carried back to the preceding Year of Assessment in S$.\n\nAny foreign sourced income received by the sole proprietorship should be translated into S$ using the average rate. All reliefs including double taxation relief, unilateral tax credit, or personal relief will be computed and allowed in S$. Tax deducted at source in respect of interest from loan stocks will be allowed based on the actual S$ amount withheld by the payer company, as shown on the Singapore tax voucher.\n\nAn example of the tax computation of an individual taxpayer whose sole proprietorship business is carried on in non-S$ functional currency is provided in the document.\n\nBusinesses are required to complete their income tax return and the appendices in S$. This is so even if they conduct their operations and submit their tax computations in non-S$ functional currencies.\n\nTo comply with this requirement, businesses need to translate the relevant non-S$ items into S$ equivalent amounts for the purpose of completing the tax return and its appendices. This can be done using the average rate or changeover rate, whichever is applicable.\n\nIf you have any enquiries or need clarification on this Guide, please call the relevant contact numbers provided.\n\nUpdates and amendments have been made to the document, including the removal of certain paragraphs that are no longer relevant, updates to footnotes, and the insertion of new paragraphs regarding elections for the transfer of property. \n\nAnnex A provides a sample tax computation for an existing company that opts for the changeover rate method. Annex B provides a sample tax computation for an existing company that opts for the average rate method. Annex C provides a sample tax computation for a newly incorporated company. Annex D provides a sample tax computation for an existing sole proprietor who opts for the changeover rate method.",

        "url": "https://www.iras.gov.sg/news-events/newsroom/over-2-million-employees-to-benefit-from-pre-filled-tax-returns--120-000-ais-employers-to-submit-employees--employment-income-data-by-1-mar-to-avoid-penalties",
        "text": "{'content': \"The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) announced that over 2 million employees will benefit from pre-filled tax returns for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2024. This initiative is part of the Auto Inclusion Scheme (AIS), which aims to simplify the tax filing process for employees. Employers are required to submit their employees' employment income data by 1 March 2024 to ensure that the information is pre-filled in the employees' tax returns. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in penalties. Employers are encouraged to submit their data early to avoid any last-minute issues and ensure their employees benefit from the pre-filled tax returns. This initiative is expected to enhance the efficiency of the tax filing process and improve compliance among taxpayers. Over 2 million employees (9 in 10 employees) whose employers are on the Auto-Inclusion Scheme (AIS) will benefit from the convenience of pre-filled tax returns, No-Filing Service (NFS) or Direct Notice of Assessment (D-NOA) for Year of Assessment 2025. This is made possible as the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) extends the AIS to about 120,000 employers, requiring them to electronically submit their employees’ 2024 employment income information to IRAS by 1 March 2025, ahead of the tax filing season. The submission requirement applies to all employers that are already on the AIS even if they have less than 5 employees in 2024, and employers that started having 5 or more employees in 2024. Non-compliance is an offence under the Income Tax Act. While the majority of the employers have been compliant, some 11,000 employers missed the AIS deadline in 2024, causing inaccurate or delayed tax assessments for 140,000 employees. Employers that do not file on time commit an offence and cause inconvenience to their employees due to the missing pre-filled employment income information. This year, 12,500 new AIS employers join the growing AIS employer base, and will submit their employees’ income data to IRAS for the first time under the AIS. This brings the number of AIS employers to about 120,000 employers. These employers would have received a letter from IRAS in January 2025 informing them of their AIS obligations. Employers that do not file by 1 March 2025 can be fined up to $5,000. Key personnel of non-compliant businesses such as company directors or precedent partners can also be fined up to $10,000, and/or face imprisonment for a term of up to 12 months. For YA 2024, 1 in 10 employers on the AIS failed to file on time (i.e., late or non-submission). IRAS prosecuted 654 repeat offenders and collected penalties exceeding $790,000 in 2024. These repeat offenders would have received multiple letters, emails and/or calls from IRAS to remind them of their filing obligations. Majority of these employers are in the food and beverage, wholesale trade and construction industries. Employers must ensure the submission of complete and accurate employment income information for their employees to IRAS, as this data will be used to calculate their employees’ tax bills. Common AIS filing errors made by employers include omitting taxable benefits-in-kind (cash/ non-cash) and employee income/ benefits outside the payroll system, incorrect reporting of accommodation benefit, as well as the under-reporting of stock/ options gains. Submitting inaccurate employees’ employment income information is an offence and may result in a penalty up to double the amount of tax undercharged. Employers are encouraged to voluntarily disclose any past errors or omissions in their employees' information immediately, for reduced penalties under IRAS’ Voluntary Disclosure Programme. More details on the Voluntary Disclosure Programme can be found at go.gov.sg/iras-iitvdp. For YA 2025, over 6,000 AIS employers are no longer required to file under the AIS as they have ceased business operations and/or no longer have employees in 2024.\", 'urls': ['https://go.gov.sg/iras-iitvdp']}",

This may not necessarily be the case when two related parties transact with each other. It is important to the integrity of the tax system that the price for the transaction between related parties approximates to the market price.\n\nTo prevent price distortion, tax authorities may audit the prices of transactions between related parties to verify if they are reflective of market prices. Such audit can lead to transfer pricing adjustments bringing about double taxation.\n\nTo reduce the risk of audits and double taxation, when transacting with their related parties, taxpayers should ensure the transfer price between them is arm’s length as if they were unrelated parties negotiating freely. Taxpayers should also maintain proper transfer pricing documentation to demonstrate that the pricing is arm’s length.\n\nIf taxpayers are faced with double taxation, they may apply for a mutual agreement procedure with their tax authorities under the DTA provisions to eliminate double taxation. They may also apply for an advance pricing arrangement to agree in advance with one or more tax authorities the appropriate transfer pricing for their related party transactions for a period of time.\n\nGlossary\n\nAdvance pricing arrangement\n\nThis is an arrangement between IRAS and the taxpayer or the relevant foreign competent authority to agree in advance an appropriate set of criteria to ascertain the transfer pricing for a taxpayer’s related party transactions for a specific period of time.\n\nArm’s length principle\n\nThe arm’s length principle is the international standard to guide transfer pricing. It requires the transaction with a related party to be made under comparable conditions and circumstances as a transaction with an independent party.\n\nArm’s length range\n\nA range of prices or margins that is acceptable for establishing that the conditions of a related party transaction are arm’s length.\n\nComparability analysis\n\nThe process of identifying economically relevant characteristics in a related party transaction and comparing such characteristics with those in independent party transactions. This involves an examination of the factors affecting the related party transaction that are non-existent in transactions between independent parties and vice-versa.\n\nComparable independent party transaction\n\nA comparable independent party transaction is a transaction between two independent parties that is comparable to the related party transaction under examination. It can be either a comparable transaction between one party which is a party to the related party transaction and two independent parties, or between independent parties, neither of which is a party to the related party transaction.\n\nComparable uncontrolled price (“CUP”) method\n\nA transfer pricing method that compares the price for properties or services transferred in a related party transaction to the price charged for properties or services transferred in an independent party transaction in comparable circumstances.\n\nCompetent Authority\n\nThis refers to a person or an organisation that has been appointed or delegated to perform a designated function. IRAS is the designated competent authority for matters relating to transfer pricing, which include advance pricing arrangement and mutual agreement procedure.\n\nContribution analysis\n\nAn analysis used in the transactional profit split method under which the total profit earned by the parties from a related party transaction is divided based on the parties’ relative contributions to the earning of that profit.\n\nCorresponding adjustment\n\nWhen a tax authority increases a taxpayer’s taxable profits as a result of applying the arm’s length principle to the taxpayer’s transactions with its related party in another jurisdiction, double taxation arises if the same profits have been or will be included in the tax base of the related party. To eliminate the double taxation, the tax authority in the other jurisdiction may agree to reduce the taxable profits of that related party. Such a downward adjustment to the related party’s taxable profit is known as corresponding adjustment.\n\nCost plus method\n\nA transfer pricing method where a comparable gross mark up is added to the costs incurred by the supplier of goods or services in a related party transaction to arrive at the arm’s length price of that transaction.\n\nDirect costs\n\nCosts that are incurred specifically for producing a product or providing a service, such as the cost of raw materials.\n\nDouble taxation\n\nWhere two or more tax authorities take different positions in determining arm’s length prices, double taxation may occur. Double taxation means that the same income is included in the tax base by two or more tax authorities, but this does not always mean that the income will actually be taxed twice.\n\nDTA (or Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement)\n\nDTA refers to agreements between governments for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion of income taxes or commonly known as tax treaties.\n\nFAR\n\nFAR refers to Functions performed, Assets used and Risks assumed.\n\nFunctional analysis\n\nA functional analysis seeks to identify the economically significant activities and responsibilities undertaken, assets used or contributed, and risks assumed by the parties to the transactions.\n\nGross profits\n\nThe amount computed by deducting from the gross receipts of a business transaction the allocable purchases or production costs of sales, with due adjustment for increases or decreases in inventory or stock-in-trade, but without taking account of other expenses.\n\nIndependent parties (or unrelated parties)\n\nTwo parties are independent (or unrelated) parties with respect to each other if they are not related parties with respect to each other.\n\nIndependent (or unrelated) party transactions\n\nTransactions between independent (or unrelated) parties.\n\nIndirect costs\n\nCosts of producing a product or service which, although closely related to the production process, may be common to several products or services (for example, the costs of a repair department that services equipment used to produce different products).\n\nITA\n\nITA refers to the Income Tax Act 1947.\n\nMutual agreement procedure\n\nThis is a facility through which IRAS and the relevant foreign competent authority resolve disputes regarding the application of DTAs.\n\nNet profit indicator (or profit level indicator)\n\nThe ratio of net profit to an appropriate base (for example, costs, sales, assets) as used in the transactional net margin method.\n\nOECD TPG\n\nOECD TPG refers to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations.\n\nRelated party\n\nTwo persons are related parties with respect to each other if:\n\n(a) Either person, directly or indirectly, controls the other person; or\n\n(b) Both persons are, directly or indirectly, controlled by a common person.\n\nThe exact wordings of the definition are provided under Section 2 of the ITA.\n\nRelated party transactions\n\nTransactions between related parties.\n\nResale price margin\n\nA margin representing the amount out of which a reseller would seek to cover its selling and other operating expenses and, in the light of the functions performed (taking into account assets used and risks assumed), make an appropriate profit.\n\nResale price method\n\nA transfer pricing method where the resale price to the independent party is reduced by a comparable resale price margin to arrive at the arm’s length price of the product transferred between the related parties.\n\nResidual analysis\n\nAn analysis used in the transactional profit split method under which the total profit earned by the parties from a related party transaction is split in two stages: firstly, by determining the return for readily identifiable functions attributed to each party involved and secondly, by dividing the residual profit.\n\nSelf-initiated retrospective adjustments\n\nDue to subsequent changes in circumstances, some taxpayers may review their past transfer prices relating to the transactions with their related parties. Arising from such review, they may decide to make retrospective upward or downward adjustments for past financial years to arrive at what, in the taxpayers’ opinion, would be the arm’s length prices. These adjustments are referred to as self-initiated retrospective adjustments.\n\nTested party\n\nThe use of resale price method, cost plus method or transactional net margin method requires a decision on which party to apply the transfer pricing analysis. This party is known as the tested party. Generally, the tested party is the one where a transfer pricing method can be applied in the most reliable manner and most reliable comparables can be found.\n\nTP Documentation Rules\n\nTP Documentation Rules refers to the Income Tax (Transfer Pricing Documentation) Rules 2018.\n\nTraditional transaction methods\n\nTransfer pricing methods that compare the prices of related party transactions with those of transactions between independent parties, namely the comparable uncontrolled price method, the resale price method, and the cost plus method.\n\nTransactional net margin method (“TNMM”)\n\nA transfer pricing method that compares the net profit relative to an appropriate base (for example, costs, sales, assets) that is attained by a taxpayer from a related party transaction to that of comparable independent parties.\n\nTransactional profit methods\n\nTransfer pricing methods that compare the profits arising from related party transactions with those generated in independent party transactions, such as the transactional net margin method and transactional profit split method.\n\nTransactional profit split method\n\nA transfer pricing method that is based on the concept of splitting the combined profits of a transaction between related parties in a similar way as how independent parties would under comparable circumstances.\n\nTransfer pricing adjustment\n\nIn the event the related parties do not transact with each other at arm’s length prices, tax authorities may for tax purposes, substitute the price of the transaction with one that could have been charged if the parties were unrelated. The adjustment to arrive at that price is known as a transfer pricing adjustment.\n\nYA\n\nYA refers to year of assessment.\n\nYear-end adjustments\n\nAdjustments which taxpayers made to their actual results at the year-end closing of their accounts to arrive at what, in the taxpayers’ opinion, would be the arm’s length prices for their related party transactions as described in their transfer pricing analyses and policies.\n\nPART I – TRANSFER PRICING PRINCIPLES AND FUNDAMENTALS\n\nBackground\n\nTransfer pricing refers to the rules and methods for pricing transactions between related parties. Such transactions can be sale or purchase of goods, provision of services, borrowing or lending of money, use or transfer of intangibles, etc.\n\nTwo persons are related parties with respect to each other if:\n\n(a) Either person, directly or indirectly, controls the other person; or\n\n(b) Both persons are, directly or indirectly, controlled by a common person.\n\nWhere a non-resident person carries on a business through a permanent establishment in Singapore, for the purpose of attributing profits to the permanent establishment:\n\n(a) The permanent establishment in Singapore of that person; and\n\n(b) Other permanent establishments outside Singapore of that person\n\nare treated as separate and distinct persons. They are considered related parties and accordingly the arm’s length principle applies to them when attributing profits to the permanent establishment in Singapore.\n\nWhen related parties transact with each other, their pricing may not reflect market conditions due to a lack of independence in their commercial and financial relations. As a result, their profits and tax liabilities may be distorted, especially when they are located in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. This creates concerns that the related parties may not be paying their fair share of tax and are able to derive a tax advantage as a group.\n\nTo ensure taxpayers transact with their related parties at pricing that reflects independent pricing, IRAS applies the internationally endorsed arm’s length principle. If taxpayers do not comply with the arm’s length principle and have understated their profits, IRAS will adjust their profits upwards as provided in the Income Tax Act 1947 (“ITA”).\n\nForeign tax authorities will likewise make upward adjustments when they find the transfer pricing of the cross-border related party transactions is not at arm’s length. Such transfer pricing adjustments, by IRAS or the foreign tax authorities, may lead to double taxation.\n\nThus, it is important that taxpayers comply with the arm’s length principle when transacting with their related parties and maintain proper transfer pricing documentation to substantiate their pricing.\n\nIRAS generally takes guidance from the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (“OECD TPG”).\n\nThe arm’s length principle\n\nIntroduction\n\nIRAS endorses the arm’s length principle as the standard to guide transfer pricing. IRAS subscribes to the principle that profits should be taxed where the real economic activities generating the profits are performed and where value is created. A proper application of the transfer pricing rules would ensure this outcome.\n\nThis section covers the following:\n\n(a) What the arm’s length principle is;\n\n(b) Basis for the arm’s length principle;\n\n(c) Reasons for endorsing the arm’s length principle;\n\n(d) Guiding principles on applying the arm’s length principle; and\n\n(e) Three-step approach to apply the arm’s length principle.\n\nWhat the arm’s length principle is\n\nThe arm’s length principle requires a transaction with a related party to be made under comparable conditions and circumstances as a transaction with an independent party. The premise is that where market forces drive the terms and conditions agreed in an independent party transaction, the pricing of the transaction would reflect the true economic value of the contributions made by each party in that transaction.\n\nTherefore, if two related parties derive profits at levels above or below the comparable market level solely because of their special relationship, the profits will be deemed as non-arm’s length. In such a case, IRAS can make necessary adjustments to the taxable profits of the taxpayer in Singapore. This is to reflect the true price that would be derived on an arm’s length basis.\n\nBasis for the arm’s length principle\n\nSection 34D of the ITA stipulates the use of the arm’s length principle for related party transactions, i.e. the conditions made or imposed between related parties with regard to their transaction are those conditions which would be made or imposed if they were not related parties and dealing independently with one another in comparable circumstances (“arm’s length conditions”).\n\nThe concept or use of the principle is also implied or referred to in various provisions of the ITA, including Sections 32 and 53.\n\nThe arm’s length principle is found in all of Singapore’s DTAs, typically in:\n\n(a) Paragraph 2 of the Business Profits Article\n\nWhen attributing profits in a contracting state/party to a permanent establishment in that state/party, the permanent establishment should be considered as “a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions”.\n\n(b) Paragraph 1 of the Associated Enterprises Article\n\n“Where…conditions are made or imposed between…two [associated] enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.”\n\nThe DTA requires the application of the arm’s length principle not only between associated enterprises but also between a permanent establishment of a person in Singapore and other permanent establishments of that person outside Singapore. The profits attributable to the permanent establishment in Singapore are the profits that the permanent establishment would have derived if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions.\n\nReasons for endorsing the arm’s length principle\n\nIRAS endorses the use of the arm’s length principle for two main reasons:\n\n(a) Market forces of supply and demand are the best way to allocate resources and reward effort. Applying the arm’s length principle would result in related and independent party transactions being treated equally for tax purposes.\n\n(b) Most tax jurisdictions adopt the arm’s length principle. In doing so, taxpayers and tax authorities will have a common basis to deal with related party transactions. This should reduce the incidence of transfer pricing adjustments and improve the resolution of transfer pricing disputes. Consequently, the likelihood of double taxation will be reduced.\n\nGuiding principles on applying the arm’s length principle\n\nIRAS recognises that the application of the arm’s length principle is not without difficulties. For instance:\n\n(a) Certain business structures and arrangements are complicated and unique, and may rarely be encountered between independent parties. The lack of comparable conditions established between independent parties makes it difficult to apply the arm’s length principle.\n\n(b) Establishing the arm’s length principle may require substantial analysis of large volume of data and information. Some information may not be readily available or may be of a confidential nature that cannot be disclosed without revealing business secrets.\n\n(c) It may also be costly for taxpayers to perform comprehensive analyses in applying the arm’s length principle and prepare sufficient documentation to demonstrate compliance with the arm’s length principle.\n\nTherefore, IRAS adopts the following guiding principles on applying the arm’s length principle:\n\n(a) Transfer pricing is not an exact science. Establishing and demonstrating compliance with the arm’s length principle require the exercise of judgment. Hence, a pragmatic approach would be adopted in ascertaining arm’s length pricing for related party transactions.\n\n(b) IRAS does not expect taxpayers to adhere rigidly to a defined set of rules in order to establish arm’s length pricing. Depending on the facts and circumstances, i.e. where there is a reasonable basis for doing so, taxpayers may determine and demonstrate arm’s length pricing using a different approach from those suggested in this e-Tax guide or complement those approaches suggested in this e-Tax guide.\n\n(c) Taxpayers would have intimate knowledge of the commercial circumstances that their businesses operate in and the economic relationships between various related parties. This puts them in a better position to perform a robust and comprehensive transfer pricing analysis to determine the arm’s length price.\n\n(d) Taxpayers should exert reasonable efforts to undertake a sound transfer pricing analysis. IRAS will consider the transfer prices determined as, prima facie, arm’s length when taxpayers have:\n\n• Applied the arm’s length principle in their analysis; and\n\n• Exercised reasonable efforts to comply with the arm’s length principle, i.e. the transfer prices may reasonably be considered to approximate to arm’s length prices.\n\n(e) IRAS welcomes taxpayers to discuss their concerns and difficulties in applying the arm’s length principle. IRAS believes that such consultation and cooperation between taxpayers and IRAS is a mutually beneficial and pragmatic way to assist taxpayers in complying with the arm’s length principle.\n\nThree-step approach to apply the arm’s length principle\n\nIRAS recommends that taxpayers adopt the following three-step approach to apply the arm’s length principle in their related party transactions:\n\nStep 1 - Conduct comparability analysis\n\nStep 2 - Identify the most appropriate transfer pricing method and tested party\n\nStep 3 - Determine the arm’s length results\n\nTransfer pricing analysis always requires an element of judgment. Ultimately, the main objective in any transfer pricing analysis is to present a logical, coherent and consistent basis to demonstrate that transfer prices set between related parties are at arm’s length.\n\nThe recommended three-step approach is neither mandatory nor prescriptive. A taxpayer can modify the recommended approach or adopt an alternative approach if its individual circumstances require such modifications to better arrive at the arm’s length result.\n\nStep 1 – Conduct comparability analysis\n\nComparability analysis is at the heart of the application of the arm’s length principle. This requires:\n\n(a) Identifying the commercial or financial relations between the related parties and the conditions and economically relevant circumstances attaching to those relations in order that the transaction between the related parties is accurately delineated.\n\n(b) Comparing the conditions and relevant circumstances of the related party transaction as accurately delineated with the conditions and the economically relevant circumstances of comparable transactions between independent parties.\n\nThe comparability analysis conducted under Step 1 will have:\n\n(a) Set out the factual substance of the commercial or financial relations between the related parties and accurately delineated the actual transaction;\n\n(b) Compared the economically relevant characteristics of the actual related party transaction and independent party transactions;\n\n(c) Identified the differences (if any) in the economically relevant characteristics between the related party transaction and the independent party transactions that can materially affect the price of the related party transaction; and\n\n(d) Determined reasonably accurate adjustments that can be made to eliminate the effect of any such differences.\n\nIdentifying the actual related party transaction\n\nThe process of identifying the commercial or financial relations between the related parties and the conditions and economically relevant circumstances attaching to those relations requires:\n\n(a) A broad understanding of the industry sector in which the group operates.\n\n(b) An analysis of what each party does and their commercial or financial relations as expressed in the transaction or transactions between them.\n\n(c) The accurate delineation of the actual transaction or transactions between them.\n\nThe accurate delineation of the actual transaction between the related parties requires establishing the economically relevant characteristics of the transaction. Such characteristics consist of the conditions of the transaction and the circumstances in which the transaction takes place. They can be broadly categorised as:\n\n(a) The contractual terms of the transaction;\n\n(b) The characteristics of goods sold or purchased, services received or provided, or intangible properties used or transferred;\n\n(c) The functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the parties; and\n\n(d) The commercial and economic circumstances of the parties.\n\nContractual terms of the transaction\n\nA transaction is the consequence of the commercial or financial relations between the related parties.\n\nWhere a transaction has been formalised by the related parties through written contractual agreements, those agreements provide the starting point for delineating the transaction between them, how the transaction is priced and how the responsibilities and risks arising from their interaction are to be divided between them at the time of entering into the agreements.\n\nWritten contractual agreements alone may not provide all the information necessary to perform a transfer pricing analysis, or to provide sufficient information regarding the contractual terms.\n\nFurther information will be required by taking into consideration the analysis of the other economically relevant characteristics mentioned in paragraphs 5.18(b) to (d). Taken together, the analysis provides evidence of the actual conduct of the related parties with regard to the transaction.\n\nWhere conduct is not fully consistent with the contractual terms, further analysis is required to identify the actual transaction.\n\nWhere there are material differences between the contractual terms and the actual conduct of the related parties, the actual transaction should be determined from the actual conduct.\n\nExample:\n\n• Parent Co in Country P has a distribution agreement with its subsidiary, Sub Co, in Country S.\n\n• Under the distribution agreement, Sub Co is to distribute Parent Co’s products and to conduct marketing activities in Country S.\n\n• Based on an analysis of the other economically relevant characteristics mentioned in paragraphs 5.18(b) to (d), it was determined that:\n\no All marketing activities are undertaken by Parent Co. i.e. full responsibility lies with Parent Co.\n\no Sub Co does not have the capability to perform marketing activities.\n\no Sub Co merely distributes the products without performing any marketing activities or incurring any costs relating to such activities.\n\n• Based on the actual conduct of Parent Co and Sub Co, it can be concluded that the written agreement does not reflect the actual conduct of the parties.\n\n• Thus, the identification of the actual transaction between Parent Co and Sub Co should not be based solely on the written agreement but should be determined from their actual conduct.\n\nWhere there is no written contractual agreement between the related parties, all aspects of the arrangement would need to be deduced from available evidence of the actual conduct of the parties. This includes the functions that are actually performed, the assets that are actually used or contributed and the risks actually assumed by the parties.\n\nCharacteristics of goods, services or intangible properties\n\nThe specific characteristics of goods, services or intangible properties play a significant part in determining their values in the open market. For instance, a product with better quality and more features would, all other things being equal, fetch a higher selling price. In other words, product or service differentiation affects the price or value of the product or service.\n\nThe nature and features of goods, intangible properties or services transacted between related parties and those between independent parties must be examined carefully. Similarities and differences should be identified as these would influence their value.\n\nImportant characteristics to be examined include:\n\nNature of transaction\n\nPossible comparisons\n\nTransfer of goods\n\n• Physical features\n• Quality and reliability\n• Availability and volume of supply\n\nProvision of services\n\nNature and extent of the services\n\nIntangible properties\n\n• Form of transaction\n• Type and nature of the intangible property\n• Duration and extent of rights provided by the intangible property\n• Anticipated benefits from the use of the intangible property\n\nIf the comparable uncontrolled price (“CUP”) method is chosen as the most appropriate transfer pricing method (see Step 2 below), ensuring similarities in the actual characteristics of the product, intangible or service would be the most critical when conducting a comparability analysis.\n\nOn the other hand, comparisons of profit margins (as used in transfer pricing methods other than CUP) may be less sensitive to the characteristics of the product or service in question. This is because the margins generally correlate more significantly with the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the taxpayer.\n\nFunctional analysis on Functions performed, Assets used and Risks assumed (“FAR”)\n\nIn transactions between two independent parties, compensation will usually reflect the functions that each enterprise performs, taking into account assets used and risks assumed. The same principle applies to transactions between related parties. Hence, a crucial step in comparability analysis is to conduct a “functional analysis” to delineate the related party transaction and determine comparability between the related party transaction and the independent party transactions.\n\nA functional analysis seeks to identify the economically significant activities and responsibilities undertaken, assets used or contributed, and risks assumed by the parties to the transactions.\n\nThe analysis focuses on what the parties actually do and the capabilities they provide. Such activities and capabilities will include decision-making. For example, decisions about business strategy and risks.\n\nThe analysis also considers the type of assets used (such as plant and equipment, valuable intangibles, financial assets, etc.) and the nature of the assets used (such as the age, market value, location, property right protections available, etc.)\n\nIdentifying risks goes hand in hand with identifying functions and assets. Risks are the effect of uncertainty on the objectives of the business. The actual assumption of risks by a taxpayer to a transaction can significantly affect the pricing of that transaction at arm’s length. Thus, when analysing risks, taxpayers should observe:\n\n(a) The effect of the risks assumed may not be apparent in the financial statements. This does not mean that the risks do not exist but it can be that the risks have been effectively managed. Therefore, taxpayer should conduct thorough functional analysis to determine what risks have been assumed, what functions are performed that relate to or affect the assumption or impact of these risks and which party or parties to the transaction assume these risks.\n\n(b) The pricing of the actual transaction should take into account the financial and other consequences of risk assumption and the remuneration for risk management. A taxpayer who assumes a risk is entitled to the upside benefits and incurs the downside costs. A taxpayer who assumes and mitigates the risk will be entitled to a greater remuneration than a taxpayer who only assumes or only mitigates the risk and does not do both.\n\n(c) To assume a risk for transfer pricing purposes, the taxpayer needs to control the risk and has the financial capacity to assume the risk.\n\nExamples:\n\n• If taxpayer claims that it assumes credit risk when customers default on payments, it would need to demonstrate that it has:\no The financial capacity to assume the risk (such as availability of credit lines from banks),\no The capability and authority to decide to take on, lay off or decline the risk (such as whether or not to sell the product to the customer or whether or not to sell on credit to customer), and\no The capability and authority to decide whether and how to respond to the risk (such as taking legal action to recover the debt).\n\nTaxpayer may outsource its day-to-day mitigation activities, such as credit risk analysis. However, it has to demonstrate that it has the capability to determine the objective of outsourcing the credit risk analysis, who it wants to hire to perform the credit risk analysis, etc.\n\n• If taxpayer claims that it assumes inventory obsolescence risk, it would need to demonstrate that it has:\no The financial capacity to assume the risk,\no The capability and authority to decide to take on, lay off or decline the risk (such as whether or not to sell a slow moving product), and\no The capability and authority to decide whether and how to respond to the risk (such as conducting marketing campaign to boost ailing sales or employing a diversification strategy).\n\nTheoretically, the level of return derived by a taxpayer should be directly correlated to the FAR. For instance, a taxpayer selling a product with warranty should earn a higher return compared to another taxpayer selling the same product without the warranty. The difference in margin is due to the additional function performed and risk assumed by the first taxpayer. Likewise, a product with a reputable branding is expected to fetch a higher return compared to that of a similar product without the branding. This is due to the additional asset (in this case, trademark) employed in enhancing the value of the product.\n\nThe example below illustrates that arm’s length compensation should reflect the outcome of a functional analysis.\n\nExample:\n\n• Company A is in the business of distributing general household electrical products in the Asia Pacific (“APAC”) region. Company A purchases these products from its parent company.\n\n• Company A conducted a thorough functional analysis which revealed:\n\nFAR\n\nDetails\n\nFunctions Besides distributing the products in the APAC region, Company A undertakes certain functions for the APAC region which include:\n• Setting and managing all marketing strategies and campaigns\n• Conducting market intelligence\n• Analysing consumer demand and the actions of its competitors\n• Determining volume to be sold\n• Setting prices for the products to be sold\n• Conducting credit analysis of customers\n\nAssets\n\nCompany A owns and operates a warehouse to store the products. To ensure orders are processed quickly and to control the inventory level of slow moving products, Company A utilises a self-inventory management developed automated system to track and process inventories and shipping orders for the APAC region.\n\nRisks\n\nCompany A demonstrated that it assumes credit risk and inventory obsolescence risk as in the examples in paragraph 5.35(c).\n\n• The arm’s length remuneration for Company A should reflect the distribution function as well as the above functions performed, assets used and risks assumed. The level of remuneration for Company A would be higher compared to another company, Company B, that merely distributes products while the above functions, assets and risks remained with Company B’s parent company.\n\nCommercial and economic circumstances\n\nComparability analysis should take into account the commercial and economic circumstances in which the related and independent parties operate.\n\nPrices may vary across different markets even for transactions involving the same property or services. In order to make meaningful comparisons between related party transactions and independent party transactions with regard to their prices or margins, the markets and economic circumstances in which the parties operate or where the transactions are undertaken should be comparable. Such comparisons include:\n\nCircumstances\n\nEconomic circumstances\n\nPossible comparisons\n\n• Availability of substitute goods or services\n• Geographic location\n• Market size\n• Extent of competition in the markets\n• Consumer purchasing power\n• Level of wholesale or retail market at which the taxpayers operate\n\nGovernment policies and regulations\n\n• Price controls\n• National insurance\n\nBusiness strategies\n\n• Innovation development and new product\n• Degree of diversification\n• Risk aversion\n• Assessment of political changes\n• Duration of arrangements\n• Other factors bearing upon the daily conduct of business\n\nComparing actual related party transaction with independent party transactions\n\nThe economically relevant characteristics of the actual related party transaction have to be compared with those of independent party transactions in order to determine an arm’s length price for the related party transaction.\n\nWhen making the comparison, these other aspects of comparability analysis are relevant:\n\n(a) Evaluating transactions on a separate or aggregate basis;\n\n(b) Using multiple year data;\n\n(c) Considering losses; and\n\n(d) Selecting comparables.\n\nEvaluating transactions on a separate or aggregate basis\n\nGenerally, the arm’s length principle should be applied on a transaction-by-transaction basis to obtain the most precise approximation of arm’s length conditions.\n\nHowever, where individual transactions are highly inter-related and it can be demonstrated that independent parties in comparable circumstances would typically price the individual transactions on an aggregate basis, taxpayers may consider evaluating the transactions on an aggregate basis.\n\nUsing multiple year data\n\nTo enhance the reliability of the comparability analysis, taxpayers should examine multiple year data as opposed to single year data. Multiple year data helps to identify factors that may have influenced or should have influenced transfer prices, such as long term arrangements and business or product life cycles.\n\nConsidering losses\n\nGenerally, businesses exist with the objective to generate profits. Therefore, a taxpayer transacting with a related party at a loss indicates that the taxpayer may not be compensated at arm’s length.\n\nSimilar to independent parties, a taxpayer transacting with a related party may sustain genuine losses for various reasons such as heavy start-up costs, unfavourable economic conditions, inefficiencies, market penetration business strategy, etc. If so, the claim should be supported with evidence that an independent party would likewise incur losses for a similar period under similar commercial and economic circumstances.\n\nSelecting comparables\n\nA sound comparability analysis requires the selection of reliable comparables. Generally, this is performed prior to or at the time of the related party transactions. These could be either internal or external comparables:\n\nComparables\n\nInternal\n\nCharacteristics\n\nPrice or margin in a comparable transaction between one party which is a party to the related party transaction and an independent party.\n\nExternal\n\nPrice or margin in a comparable transaction between two independent parties, neither of which is a party to the related party transaction.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates internal and external comparables:\n\nComparable circumstances\n\nrelated party transaction\n\nA (taxpayer)\n\nB (related party)\n\nindependent party transaction (internal comparable)\n\nC (independent party)\n\nindependent party transaction (external comparable)\n\nD (independent party)\n\nGenerally, internal comparables may have a more direct and closer relationship to the transaction under review compared to external comparables. Hence, they are preferred because the financial analysis typically would be based on similar accounting standards and information on the comparable transactions would be readily available and more reliable.\n\nInternal comparables may not always be more comparable than external comparables. For example, a taxpayer may sell a significant volume of products to its foreign related party and a much smaller volume to an independent party. The difference in sales volumes is likely to materially affect the comparability of the two transactions. In this case, it may be necessary to search for external comparables that are more comparable.\n\nWhen selecting external comparables, taxpayers should consider the following:\n\n(a) Commercial databases\n\nIRAS does not have a preference for any particular commercial database as long as it provides a reliable source of information that assists taxpayers in performing comparability analysis. Whichever database the taxpayer chooses, transfer pricing documentation should be maintained to demonstrate the results of its comparability analysis.\n\n(b) Comparables with publicly available information\n\nTaxpayers should only use comparables with publicly available information. Such information can be readily obtained from various sources and verified, making the analyses of these comparables more reliable compared to those based on privately held information.\n\nBetween a company that is listed on a stock exchange and one that is not listed, IRAS prefers the former as a comparable because there is generally more information available in the public domain compared to the latter.\n\n(c) Non-local comparables\n\nAs far as possible, taxpayers should use local comparables in their comparability analysis. Generally, these comparables have a higher degree of comparability in terms of their market and economic circumstances compared to non-local comparables. When taxpayers are unable to find sufficiently reliable local comparables, they may expand their search to regional comparables.\n\n(d) Loss-generating comparables\n\nIn conducting their comparability analysis, taxpayers may come across independent parties which have sustained losses over a period of time. If other independent parties have generated profits for a similar period under similar commercial and economic circumstances, the question arises whether the transactions of the loss-making parties are truly reflective of normal business conditions. The persistently loss-making independent parties are therefore likely to be less reliable comparables. Under such circumstances, taxpayers should exclude as comparables independent parties with the following financial results:\n\n• Weighted average loss for the tested period; or\n\n• Loss incurred for more than half of the tested period.\n\nWhere there are differences between the economically relevant characteristics of the actual related party transaction and independent party transactions, it is important to consider whether there is comparability between the transactions and what adjustments may be necessary to achieve comparability.\n\nDesired outcome of Step 1\n\nThe aim of the comparability analysis is a comprehensive assessment and identification of significant similarities and differences (such as product characteristics, functions performed, etc.) between the taxpayers or transactions in question and those entities or transactions to be benchmarked against.\n\nWhere reasonably accurate adjustments could be made for material differences identified, the method of making or computing such adjustments should be documented.\n\nA thorough understanding of the level of comparability is necessary in deciding the choice of transfer pricing method and tested party (see Step 2 below).\n\nStep 2 – Identify the most appropriate transfer pricing method and tested party\n\nThere are five internationally accepted methods for evaluating a taxpayer’s transfer prices or margins against a benchmark based on the prices or margins adopted by independent parties in similar transactions.\n\nThese five methods can be categorised as follows:\n\nTraditional transaction methods Transactional profits methods\n\n• CUP method\n• Resale price method\n• Cost plus method\n\n• Transactional profit split method\n• Transactional net margin method (“TNMM”)\n\nTraditional transaction methods compare the price of related party transactions with that of transactions between independent parties. On the other hand, transactional profits methods compare the profit arising from related party transactions with that generated in independent party transactions.\n\nCUP method\n\nThe CUP method compares the following two prices:\n\n(a) The price charged for properties or services transferred in a related party transaction; and\n\n(b) The price charged for properties or services transferred in an independent party transaction in comparable circumstances.\n\nA difference between the two prices above may suggest that the related parties are not dealing at arm’s length. Therefore, the price in the related party transaction may need to be substituted with the price in the independent party transaction.\n\nThe price or value of a property or service is very sensitive to differing characteristics, functions performed and market conditions, etc. Hence, the CUP method is reliable only if:\n\n(a) There is high level of comparability between the related party transaction and the independent party transaction; or\n\n(b) Reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the effects of material differences.\n\nAs the CUP method is the most direct way to determine arm’s length price, it should generally be preferred to the other methods. However, a less direct method is necessary if comparable independent party transactions cannot be found or where reasonably accurate adjustments for differences in comparability cannot be made.\n\nThe CUP method is most suitable to evaluate transactions involving products with very similar characteristics (in terms of type, physical features, quality and quantity transacted, etc.) and undertaken in similar market or economic conditions, such as widely traded commodities. As there should not be much product differentiation for the use of the CUP method, similarities in product characteristics and market or economic conditions are much more significant considerations than the FAR of the taxpayers in determining the suitability of the CUP method.\n\nTaxpayers should rely on internal comparables as far as possible. External comparables may be used if no reliable internal comparable transactions exist. Example 1 and Example 2 in Annex A illustrate the use of an “internal CUP” and an “external CUP” respectively.\n\nResale price method\n\nThe resale price method is applied where a product that has been purchased from a related party is resold to an independent party. Essentially, it values the functions performed by the “reseller” of a product.\n\nIn this method, the resale price to the independent party is reduced by a comparable gross margin (the “resale price margin”) to arrive at the arm’s length price of the product transferred between the related parties.\n\nUnder arm’s length conditions, the resale price margin should allow the reseller to recover its selling and operating costs, and earn a reasonable profit based on its FAR.\n\nAs gross profit margins represent the gross compensation (after cost of sales) for specific FAR, product differences are less critical than under the CUP method. Therefore, where the related and independent party transactions are comparable in all aspects except the product, the resale price method may be more reliable than the CUP method. Nonetheless, the more comparable the products, the more likely the resale price method will produce better results.\n\nIf there are material differences that affect the resale price margin earned in the related and independent party transactions, adjustments should be made to eliminate the effects of those differences.\n\nThe resale price method is most appropriate where the reseller adds relatively little value to the properties. The more value the reseller adds to the properties (for example, via complicated processing or assembly with other products), the harder it is to apply the resale price method. This is especially so where the reseller contributes significantly to creating or maintaining intangible properties, such as trademarks or trade names, in its activities.\n\nTaxpayers should rely on internal comparables as far as possible. External comparables may be used if no reliable internal comparable transactions exist. Example 3 in Annex A illustrates the use of the resale price method.\n\nCost plus method\n\nThe cost plus method focuses on the gross mark up obtained by a supplier for property transferred or services provided to a related purchaser. Essentially, it values the functions performed by the supplier of the property or services.\n\nIn this method, a comparable gross mark up is added to the costs of the supplier of goods or services (“cost base”) in the related party transaction to arrive at the arm’s length price of that transaction.\n\nSimilar to the resale price method, fewer adjustments may be necessary to account for product differences compared to the CUP method. It may be appropriate to focus on other factors of comparability, such as the FAR and economic circumstances of the tested party and the comparable entities.\n\nApplying the cost plus method requires the comparability of the gross mark up and cost base in the related and independent party transactions. If the related and independent party transactions are not comparable in all aspects and the differences have a material effect on the price or margin, adjustments should be made to eliminate the effects of those differences.\n\nGenerally, costs can be classified as follows:\n\nType of cost\n\nDirect costs\n\nIndirect costs\n\nExamples\n\n• Cost of raw materials\n• Cost of labour\n\n• Depreciation\n• Repair and maintenance which may be allocated among several products\n\nOperating expenses\n\n• Marketing\n• General and administrative\n\nIn applying the cost plus method, direct and indirect costs of producing a good or providing a service are normally used to compute the cost base. Such costs are limited to the costs of the supplier of goods or services and should take into account an analysis of the supplier’s FAR. The methods of determining the cost base should be consistent over time.\n\nIf the supplier of goods or services is the tested party and is a taxpayer in Singapore, the cost base should be determined according to the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards. Where necessary, adjustments will be made to ensure the cost base is arm’s length. This means that the cost base may include costs not reflected in the tested party’s accounts.\n\nExample:\n\n• Company A provides services to its related party, Company B.\n• Company B bore certain cost of $100,000 for the benefit of Company A and related to the services provided by A.\n• Company B did not allocate the $100,000 to Company A.\n• Based on an analysis of FAR of Company A and Company B, the $100,000 should be allocated to Company A.\n• In determining the cost base for the services provided to Company B, the cost base will be adjusted to include the $100,000 even though this amount has not been allocated to Company A and is not reflected in its accounts.\n\nTransactional profit split method (residual analysis approach)\n\nCompany A is a Singapore manufacturing and sales company for telecommunication products. It developed an original microprocessor and holds the patent for the manufacturing technology. Company F, an overseas subsidiary of Company A, develops and manufactures mobile equipment using the new microprocessor as well as technology developed by itself.\n\nCompany F is the only manufacturer licensed by Company A to use the new microprocessor. Company A purchases all of the mobile equipment manufactured by Company F and sells them to third parties.\n\nBoth companies contribute to the success of the mobile equipment through their design of the microprocessor and the equipment. As the nature of the products is very advanced and unique, the group is unable to locate any comparable with similar intangible assets. Therefore, neither the traditional methods nor the TNMM is appropriate in this case.\n\nNevertheless, the group is able to obtain reliable data on handphone contract manufacturers and equipment wholesalers without unique intangible property in the telecommunication industry. The manufacturers earn a mark up of 10% while the wholesalers derive a 25% margin on sales.\n\nSingCo’s and Company F’s respective share of profit is determined in two stages using the transactional profit split method (residual analysis approach).\n\nStage 1 – Determining the return for routine contributions\n\nThe simplified accounts of Company F and Company A are shown below:\n\nCompany F (S$)\n\nSingCo (S$)\n\nSales\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nGross Margin\n\nSales, General & Admin\n\nOperating Margin\n\n100\n\n(60)\n\n40\n\n(5)\n\n35\n\nThe total operating profit for the group is S$45.\n\nCompany F\n\nCost of goods sold\n\nCost mark up of contract manufacturer (10% x S$60)\n\nTransfer price based on comparables (without intangibles)\n\n125\n\n(100)\n\n25\n\n(15)\n\n10\n\nS$60\n\nS$6\n\nS$66\n\nThe total operating margin of the group is S$17.25.\n\nStage 2: Dividing the residual profit\n\nThe residual profit of the group = S$45 – S$17.25 = S$27.75\n\nOn further study of the two companies, two particular expense items, research and development (“R&D”) expenses and marketing expenses, are identified as contributing to the key intangibles critical to the success of the mobile equipment. The R&D expenses and marketing expenses incurred by each company are as follows:\n\nSingCo\n\nCompany F\n\nS$12 (80%)\n\nS$3 (20%)\n\nAssuming that the R&D and marketing expenses are equally significant in contributing to the residual profit, based on the proportionate expenses incurred:\n\nSingCo’s share of residual profit (80% x S$27.75)\n\nCompany F’s share of residual profit (20% x S$27.75)\n\nS$22.20\n\nS$5.55\n\nTherefore, the adjusted operating profits of each company are as follows:\n\nSingCo\n\nCompany F\n\n= S$5.55 + S$1\n\n= S$22.20 + S$16.25\n\n= S$38.45\n\nThe adjusted tax accounts are as follows:\n\nSales\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nGross Margin\n\nSales, General & Admin\n\nOperating Margin\n\nCompany F (S$)\n\nSingCo (S$)\n\n71.55\n\n(60.00)\n\n11.55\n\n(5.00)\n\n6.55\n\n125.00\n\n(71.55)\n\n53.45\n\n(15.00)\n\n38.45\n\nHence, the transfer price determined using the transactional profit split method (residual analysis approach) should be S$71.55.\n\nTransactional net margin method\n\nCompany A is a Singapore manufacturer of dishwashers. All of Company A’s dishwashers are sold to an overseas related party, Company G, and bear Company G’s brand. Company G, a household electrical appliances brand name, sells only dishwashers manufactured by Company A.\n\nThe CUP method is not applied in this case because no reliable adjustments can be made to account for differences with similar products in the market.\n\nAfter the appropriate functional analysis, Company A was able to identify a Singapore manufacturer of home electrical appliances, Company H, as a suitable comparable company. However, Company H performs warranty functions for its independent wholesalers, whereas Company A does not. Company H realizes a net mark up or operating margin of 10%.\n\nAs the costs pertaining to the warranty functions cannot be separately identified in Company H’s accounts and no reliable adjustments can be made to account for the difference in the functions, it may be more reliable to examine the net margins in this case. The transfer price for Company A’s sale of dishwashers to Company G is computed using the TNMM as follows:\n\nCompany A’s cost of goods sold\n\nCompany A’s operating expenses\n\nTotal costs\n\nAdd: Net mark up (10% x S$6,500)\n\nTransfer price based on TNMM\n\nS$5,000\n\nS$1,500\n\nS$6,500\n\nS$650\n\nS$7,150\n\nThe above example is based on an external comparable. Company A’s transactions with Company G, a related party, are benchmarked against the transactions between Company H and independent parties.\n\nIf reliable internal comparables exist, the same analysis should be undertaken using internal comparables. Company A’s related party transactions with Company G are benchmarked against comparable transactions between Company A and an independent party.\n\nANNEX B – Samples and guides for MAP and APA process\n\nAnnex B1: Sample of letter of authorisation\n\nNote: The letter is to be printed on the taxpayer’s letterhead\n\n[Date]\n\nInternational Tax and Relations Division\nTransfer Pricing and Dispute Resolution Branch\nInland Revenue Authority of Singapore\n55 Newton Road\nSingapore 307987\n\nAttention: [IRAS Case Officer]\n\nLETTER OF AUTHORITY- APPLICATION FOR *[MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE (“MAP”)/ BILATERAL ADVANCE PRICING ARRANGEMENT (“BAPA”)/ UNILATERAL ADVANCE PRICING ARRANGEMENT (“UAPA”)] BY [NAME(S) OF TAXPAYER(S)]\n\nDear Sir/ Madam,\n\nThis is to advise that we have appointed [Tax agent/ representative (Name and contact information)] to represent us on all matters relating to the above application.

        "text": "FAQs on Spontaneous Exchange of Information\n\n1. Why did Singapore commit to the spontaneous exchange of information on certain rulings under the OECD framework?\n\nSingapore is a member of the Inclusive Framework (IF) for the global implementation of the BEPS Project. The spontaneous exchange of information on certain rulings is a minimum standard under the BEPS Project to be implemented by IF members.\n\n2. Who will Singapore spontaneously exchange the information with?\n\nSingapore will spontaneously exchange information with a jurisdiction only if that jurisdiction:\n- has a tax treaty or exchange of information arrangement with Singapore that provides for the spontaneous exchange of information;\n- has the necessary legal framework and safeguards to ensure confidentiality and appropriate use of the information exchanged; and\n- is similarly committed to compulsory spontaneous exchange of information under the framework.\n\nAs a general rule, the spontaneous exchange of information on rulings will take place with the following jurisdictions who meet the above criteria:\n- jurisdictions of residence of all related parties with which the taxpayer enters into transactions for which a ruling is granted or which gives rise to income from related parties benefitting from a preferential treatment (this rule also applies in a PE context); and\n- jurisdictions of residence of the taxpayer’s ultimate parent entity and the immediate parent entity, and in the case of PE rulings, the residence jurisdiction of the PE’s head office.\n\n3. What is the related party threshold for the purpose of spontaneous exchange of information?\n\nTwo parties would be considered related if the first person has a 25% or greater shareholding in the second person or there is a third person that holds a 25% or greater shareholding in both. A person will be treated as holding a percentage shareholding in another person if that person holds directly or indirectly through a shareholding in other persons, that percentage of the voting rights of that person or of the value of any equity interests of that person. The same threshold will apply for other entities such as partnerships and trusts.\n\n4. How will IRAS determine whether a jurisdiction has the necessary legal framework and safeguards to ensure confidentiality and appropriate use of the information exchanged?\n\nThe Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (the Global Forum), which currently comprises more than 140 jurisdictions, including Singapore, is the international body responsible for ensuring the implementation of the internationally agreed standards of transparency and exchange of information in the tax area. It does so through a peer review process which examines a jurisdiction’s legal and regulatory framework, and the implementation of this framework in practice. The assessment of the Global Forum in this regard will strongly influence IRAS’ determination of whether a jurisdiction has the necessary legal framework and safeguards to ensure confidentiality and appropriate use of the information exchanged.\n\n5. When will Singapore spontaneously exchange the information?\n\nRulings issued on or after 1 April 2017 but before 1 January 2025 will be exchanged as soon as possible and no later than three months after the date on which the ruling becomes available to IRAS. Rulings issued on or after 1 January 2025 will be exchanged within six months from the date of issue of the ruling. The date of issue of the ruling is the date the ruling is accepted by the taxpayer.\n\n6. Will taxpayers be informed when their information is exchanged?\n\nAs a matter of practice, taxpayers will not be informed if and when their information is exchanged, or of who the information has been exchanged with. Taxpayers should expect that information falling within the five categories of rulings that Singapore has committed to spontaneously exchange will be exchanged within the timeframe indicated in FAQ 5 and with the parties as identified in FAQ 2, 3, and 4.",

        "title": "Multinational Enterprise Top-up Tax and Domestic Top-up Tax (PDF, 0.9 MB)",
        "url": "https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/e-tax-guide-mtt-and-dtt.pdf?sfvrsn=e95bc2a9_7",
        "text": "Multinational Enterprise Top-up Tax and Domestic Top-up Tax\n\nThis e-Tax guide sets out the key parameters of the MTT and DTT which are provided in the MMT Act and subsidiary legislations. Further guidance on MTT and DTT, such as on the transition rules and safe harbours, will be released progressively.\n\nThis e-Tax guide is relevant to MNE groups with annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more in the CFS of the UPE in at least two of the four preceding FYs, in line with the Pillar Two GloBE rules.\n\nAs announced in the 2024 Budget Statement, Singapore will implement a DTT and the IIR under Pillar Two of the BEPS 2.0 initiative, which will impose a minimum ETR of 15% on businesses’ profits from FYs starting on or after 1 January 2025. The MMT Act has been enacted to implement the IIR (which is referred to as the MTT in the Act) and DTT. The MTT and DTT are based on the published GloBE Model Rules, Commentary and AGs.\n\nMTT and DTT apply to MNE groups with annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more in the CFS of the UPE in at least two out of the four preceding FYs (also known as in-scope MNE groups).\n\nThe UPE of an in-scope MNE group must notify the Comptroller of Income Tax (the “Comptroller”) of its liability to be registered under the MMT Act. The Comptroller may register an in-scope MNE group that fails to register.\n\nAll registered MNE groups liable for MTT and/or DTT are required to file tax returns on their top-up tax liability in Singapore. All registered MNE groups are also required to file a GIR with Singapore, unless the GIR is filed with another jurisdiction and in such a case, a GloBE notification (if Singapore will receive the GIR through a filing made in another jurisdiction via exchange of information) must be filed with Singapore.\n\nIn October 2021, the IF agreed on a two-pillar solution (commonly known as BEPS 2.0) to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. As part of Pillar Two under BEPS 2.0, the GloBE Model Rules and its Commentary were released on 20 December 2021 and 14 March 2022, respectively. These, together with AGs issued subsequently, are known as the “GloBE rules”.\n\nThe GloBE rules comprise the IIR and the UTPR. Broadly, the GloBE rules are designed to ensure that in-scope MNE groups pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction where they operate. A top-up tax on excess profits arising in a jurisdiction will be imposed whenever the ETR of the MNE group, determined on a jurisdictional basis, is below the minimum rate of 15%.\n\nThe GloBE rules recognise that jurisdictions may introduce domestic minimum top-up taxes to bring the ETR of LTCEs operating in those jurisdictions to 15%. Where such taxes are regarded as QDMTTs under the GloBE rules, they will reduce the top-up tax that would otherwise arise under IIR or UTPR in respect of such LTCEs.\n\nSingapore will implement MTT and DTT for businesses’ FYs starting on or after 1 January 2025. The MTT and DTT are based on the published GloBE Model Rules, Commentary and AGs. A summary table of provisions in the MMT Act, and (if applicable) the corresponding provisions in the published GloBE Model Rules, Commentary and AGs, is at Annex B.\n\nMTT and DTT will apply to an MNE group for a FY beginning on or after 1 January 2025. For this purpose, the FY is generally determined based on the accounting period of the UPE’s CFS.\n\nThis means that if the CFS of the UPE of an MNE group are prepared for an accounting period from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025, MTT and DTT will apply to in-scope entities of that MNE group whose financial results are consolidated into that CFS for the same period i.e. 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. This applies even if the FYs of some of the in-scope entities do not begin from 1 January 2025 (e.g. the entities’ FY could be from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025 for their individual financial accounts, but they will nonetheless be considered as in-scope entities from 1 January 2025).\n\nMTT and DTT apply to an MNE group that has annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more in the CFS of the UPE in at least two of the four FYs immediately preceding the tested FY (the “revenue threshold”). The following table illustrates how the revenue threshold is to be applied:\n\nWhen determining whether an MNE group meets the revenue threshold, the annual revenue threshold of EUR 750 million is adjusted proportionally to correspond with the period covered by the relevant FY. For example, if a FY of an MNE group consists of only 9 months, then the applicable annual revenue threshold for that particular FY will be EUR 562.5 million (750 million x 9/12).\n\nNotwithstanding Section 5, certain entities are not subject to the MTT and DTT (i.e. excluded entities). MTT and DTT adopt the same scope of excluded entities as the GloBE rules. This means that:\n\na. Attributes of excluded entities such as their profits, losses, taxes accrued, tangible assets, and payroll expenses are excluded from the various computations under MTT and DTT including the de minimis exclusion.\n\nb. However, the revenue of excluded entities would still be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the revenue threshold of the MNE group in paragraph 5.1 is met.\n\nc. Excluded entities do not have any administrative obligations under MTT and DTT, such as the filing of a GIR.\n\nExamples of excluded entities include a governmental entity, an international organisation and a non-profit organisation. Please refer to Article 1.5 of the GloBE Model Rules and its accompanying Commentary for further information.\n\nBesides excluded entities, the MTT and DTT regimes also provide for the following three types of exclusions in accordance with the GloBE rules as stated below. These three types of exclusions affect the computation of the top-up amount under the GloBE rules. They do not affect the determination of whether the revenue threshold of the MNE group is met and the administrative obligations for the MNE group under the MTT and DTT regimes:\n\na. International Shipping Income Exclusion: A CE’s international shipping income or qualified ancillary international shipping income is excluded from the computation of its GloBE income or loss if the strategic or commercial management of all ships concerned is effectively carried on within the jurisdiction where the CE is located.\n\nb. SBIE: The SBIE provides for a formulaic, substance-based carve-out, based on a percentage of the eligible payroll costs and carrying value of eligible tangible assets of the MNE group. The SBIE seeks to exclude a fixed return for substantive activities within a jurisdiction from the application of the GloBE rules.\n\nc. De Minimis Exclusion: MNE groups may make an annual election for the de minimis exclusion. To qualify for a de minimis exclusion for a jurisdiction for a FY, (a) the average GloBE revenue of CEs (not being stateless entities, investment entities or insurance investment entities) in the jurisdiction for that FY and the two preceding FYs must be less than EUR 10 million and (b) the average GloBE income of those CEs for the same period must be less than EUR 1 million or the CEs must be in a loss position. If so, the top-up amounts for that FY of those CEs are deemed to be nil.\n\nThe MTT and DTT regimes also provide for safe harbours that help reduce the MNE groups’ compliance burden (e.g. avoiding the need for detailed MTT or DTT calculations). Where a safe harbour is elected by an MNE group for a jurisdiction, the top-up amounts for qualifying entities of the MNE group in the jurisdiction are treated as nil. Currently, the GloBE rules provide for four safe harbours:\n\nSafe harbours (a) to (c) mentioned above will treat the top-up amounts under MTT, DTT or both (as the case may be) as nil, where applicable.\n\nMTT applies to a Singapore parent entity’s ownership interest in its relevant entities outside Singapore and its stateless entities but does not apply to its ownership interest in its domestic entities. The minimum rate for MTT is 15% and the top-up amount is computed using the ETR that is calculated on a jurisdictional basis for an MNE group.\n\nAn entity is a chargeable entity for MTT if it is a responsible member located in Singapore of an MNE group and holds an ownership interest in a CE located outside Singapore or a stateless entity of the MNE group that has a top-up amount for the FY (called a relevant entity).\n\nA responsible member of an MNE group is any of the following entities located in Singapore or subject to a qualified IIR in the jurisdiction where it is located:\n\na. the UPE of the MNE group;\n\nb. an intermediate parent entity of the MNE group if no other member of the MNE group that owns a controlling interest in the entity is a responsible member (e.g. the UPE);\n\nc. a partially-owned parent entity of the MNE group if it is not wholly-owned by another partially-owned parent entity of the MNE group that is a responsible member.\n\nThe amount of MTT chargeable on a chargeable entity for a FY is the sum of the top-up tax of each relevant entity of the chargeable entity for the FY.\n\nWhere the chargeable entity holds its indirect ownership interest in a relevant entity X through another responsible member of the MNE group, the amount of MTT payable by the chargeable entity is reduced by the proportionate amount of MTT or any qualified IIR payable by that responsible member in respect of the relevant entity X. This situation may arise, for example, when the chargeable entity is a UPE and holds an ownership interest in another responsible member that is a partially-owned parent entity; hence both the chargeable entity and that responsible member would pay respectively MTT or qualified IIR in respect of the same relevant entity.\n\nFor a relevant entity (that is not an investment entity or an insurance investment entity) of a chargeable entity, the top-up tax for a FY is computed as follows:\n\nTop-up tax = (Top-up amount of the relevant entity for the FY) x (Chargeable entity’s inclusion ratio for the relevant entity for the FY)\n\nThe chargeable entity’s inclusion ratio for a relevant entity for a FY is the proportion of the GloBE income of the relevant entity for the FY that is not attributable to entities other than the chargeable entity.\n\nIn accordance with the GloBE rules, separate computations of top-up amount are required for each category of entities, or each special entity as the case may be.\n\nThe top-up amount of a CE that is not a special entity is determined as follows:\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1: For each CE in the MNE group,\na. Determine GloBE income or loss\nb. Determine adjusted covered taxes\n\nStep 2: For each jurisdiction,\na. Aggregate the GloBE income or loss of all CEs (that are not special entities) located in that jurisdiction\nb. Aggregate the adjusted covered taxes of all those CEs\nc. Determine ETR for that jurisdiction by dividing (b) by (a)\n\nStep 3: For each of those jurisdictions with ETR below 15% or have an additional current top-up amount,\na. Determine the jurisdictional top-up amount\nb. Determine the top-up amount of each CE (that is not a special entity) by apportioning the jurisdictional top-up amount\n\nThe jurisdictional top-up amount for the MNE group for a jurisdiction for a FY is determined as follows:\n\n(Top-up tax percentage x Excess profits) + Additional current top-up amount\n\nThe top-up tax percentage for the MNE group for a jurisdiction for a FY is the difference between the minimum rate of 15% and the ETR for the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the FY (if the ETR is less than 15%). The top-up tax percentage is nil if the ETR for the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the FY is 15% or more.\n\nThe excess profits for the MNE group for a jurisdiction for a FY is the sum of the GloBE income or loss for the FY of the CEs (not being special entities) of the MNE group located in the jurisdiction less the SBIE for the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the FY. The excess profits for the MNE group for the jurisdiction for the FY cannot be less than nil.\n\nThe jurisdictional top-up amount for the MNE group for a jurisdiction for the FY is apportioned between the CEs (not being special entities) of the MNE group that are located in that jurisdiction. The apportionment is generally based on the GloBE income of the CEs for the FY.\n\nThe top-up amount of an entity that is a special entity is determined as follows:\n\nType of special entity\n\nTreatment\n\nStateless entity\n\nTop-up amount is determined in a similar manner as paragraph 7.3.7 above and modified accordingly for these respective special entities so that separate ETRs will apply to these special entities.\n\nMinority-owned CE and member of a minority-owned subgroup\n\nTop-up amount is determined in a similar manner as paragraph 7.3.7 above except as specified below. The ETR of a minority-owned CE is calculated separately from any other CEs in the same jurisdiction. If the MNE group owns interests in minority-owned CEs located in the same jurisdiction, a single ETR is computed for all such entities in the jurisdiction.\n\nJoint venture and JV subsidiary\n\nTop-up amount is determined in a similar manner as paragraph 7.3.7 above and modified accordingly for these respective special entities so that separate ETRs will apply to these special entities.\n\nInvestment entity and insurance investment entity\n\nTop-up amount is determined in a similar manner as paragraph 7.3.7 above except as specified below. The ETR of an investment entity or insurance investment entity is calculated separately from any other CEs in the same jurisdiction. If the MNE group owns interests in investment entities or insurance entities located in the same jurisdiction, a single ETR is computed for all such entities in the jurisdiction.\n\nThe calculations for MTT are to be carried out in the presentation currency of the UPE’s CFS.\n\nThe currency used for thresholds in the MMT Act are based on Euros. For the purpose of determining whether relevant threshold amounts in the MMT Act are met, an MNE group whose UPE’s CFS presentation currency is not in Euros must translate the relevant amounts in its financial statements to Euros. Such translation is to be based on the average foreign exchange rate for the December month of the calendar year immediately before the relevant FY. The “average foreign exchange rate” is the average foreign exchange rate quoted by the ECB for that month. Where the ECB does not provide such a foreign exchange reference rate for the presentation currency, the average foreign exchange rate would generally be the rate made available by the Monetary Authority of Singapore for that month.\n\nDTT is a tax imposed in Singapore on MNE groups that meet the revenue threshold in paragraph 5.1, in addition to CIT.\n\nDTT applies to in-scope entities of an MNE group. It does not apply to a wholly domestic group.\n\nIn-scope entities for DTT refer to the following categories of entities of or connected to an MNE group:\n\na. the members (including partially owned CEs) of the MNE group located in Singapore;\n\nb. joint ventures and JV subsidiaries located in Singapore;\n\nc. members of a minority-owned subgroup, and minority-owned CEs located in Singapore; and\n\nd. reverse hybrid entities which are formed, registered or incorporated in Singapore; and are not responsible members.\n\nDTT does not apply to CEs that are located outside Singapore, excluded entities, stateless permanent establishments and tax transparent entities of MNE groups. MTT, qualified IIR or qualified UTPR may apply to these entities instead. For investment entities and insurance investment entities that are located in Singapore, the top-up amount of these entities is treated as nil for DTT purpose.\n\nDTT is applicable to in-scope entities of the MNE group located in Singapore that are excluded from the UTPR under Article 9.3 of GloBE Model Rules.\n\nDTT is designed to meet the conditions of a QDMTT such that the DTT liability will be offset against any IIR/UTPR liabilities in respect of low-taxed profits of in-scope entities located in Singapore that may arise from the application of the GloBE rules in other jurisdictions.\n\nDTT is also designed to satisfy the requirements of the QDMTT Safe Harbour. Where the QDMTT Safe Harbour applies under the GloBE rules in other jurisdictions, the application of the GloBE rules in these jurisdictions is turned off by treating any top-up tax payable under the GloBE rules to be nil. In this way, MNE groups only undertake one computation for QDMTT (i.e. DTT in Singapore) without the need to make a further calculation under the GloBE rules in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe DTT ensures that in-scope entities of an MNE group located in Singapore will be charged a top-up amount (that is, the DTT) if their jurisdictional ETR is below 15%. This will raise the ETR of the MNE group to 15% in Singapore. DTT is calculated in a similar way to MTT with the exceptions highlighted in paragraphs 8.7.1 and 9.1.\n\nA CE in Singapore, known as a DFE, will be chargeable with DTT of an MNE group, unless the MNE group makes an election to allocate a specified amount of the DTT to a qualifying CE. A qualifying CE does not include a:\n\na. CE with GloBE loss;\n\nb. CE which is a flow-through entity that is not a reverse hybrid entity;\n\nc. CE with ETR of 15% or more; and\n\nd. CE which is no longer in the MNE group e.g. the CE has left the MNE group or ceased to exist after the reported FY.\n\nIf the DFE does not pay DTT on-time resulting in DTT in arrears, every CE located in Singapore of an MNE group, joint venture and JV subsidiary located in Singapore which are connected with the MNE group, and reverse hybrid entity of the MNE group will be jointly and severally liable for the DTT or interest in arrears for the FY that the DTT relates to.\n\nThe top-up amount of the MNE group is the sum of the following:\n\na. the top-up amount of the CEs (other than special entities) located in Singapore;\n\nb. the top-up amount of any joint venture and JV subsidiary located in Singapore;\n\nc. the top-up amount of the members of a minority-owned subgroup and minority-owned CEs located in Singapore; and\n\nd. the top-up amount of each reverse hybrid entity (not being a responsible member) formed, registered or incorporated in Singapore.\n\nSimilar to MTT, separate computation of top-up amount for each category of entities, or each special entity is required.\n\nThe tax payable under DTT is the whole jurisdictional top-up amount, regardless of the level of ownership interest of the parent entity in the in-scope entities.\n\nThe jurisdictional top-up amount is computed based on the following formula:\n\n(Top-up tax percentage x Excess profits) + Additional current top-up amount\n\nThe top-up tax percentage is the difference between the 15% minimum rate and the ETR of the MNE group in Singapore, while the excess profits is the difference between the sum of the GloBE income or loss of the entities located in Singapore less the SBIE for those entities.\n\nThe computation of DTT is in accordance with the GloBE rules and the conditions for QDMTT and QDMTT Safe Harbour. In particular, for the purpose of computing ETR in Singapore, DTT does not take into account the allocation of cross-border taxes such as CFC taxes incurred by a parent entity or taxes incurred by a foreign main entity with respect to profits attributable to its permanent establishment in Singapore.\n\nThe DTT computations are based on the financial statements prepared in accordance with the LFAS rule subject to the conditions therein.\n\nThe local financial accounting standards refer to:\n\n• Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I));\n• Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS); or\n• Singapore Financial Reporting Standards for Small Entities (SFRS for SE)\n\nDTT computation will be determined based on LFAS if all the CEs of the MNE group located in Singapore have financial statements prepared in accordance with the accounting standards made or formulated under Part 3 of Singapore’s Accounting Standards Act 2007 and:\n\n• the CEs are required to keep or use such accounts under any written law in Singapore; or\n• such financial statements are audited by an external financial auditor.\n\nWhere not all CEs located in Singapore meet the above requirements or the FY of their financial statements is different from the FY of the CFS of the UPE, the DTT computations shall be computed based on the financial accounting standard used in the preparation of the CFS of the UPE.\n\nThe table below summarises the key differences between MTT and DTT.\n\nMTT is a tax imposed on the low-taxed income of CEs, joint ventures and JV subsidiaries located outside Singapore and stateless CEs. DTT is imposed on the low-taxed income of CEs, joint ventures and JV subsidiaries located in Singapore, and reverse hybrid entities formed, registered or incorporated in Singapore which are not responsible members.\n\nThe parent entity that is a responsible member located in Singapore is responsible for the payment of MTT, while the DFE is responsible for the payment of DTT.\n\nThe currency computation for MTT is based on the presentation currency per UPE’s CFS, while for DTT, it is based on Singapore dollar where the DTT is determined in accordance with the LFAS and all CEs in Singapore are using Singapore dollar as their functional currency in their financial statements.\n\nMTT applies to investment entities and insurance investment entities, while DTT does not apply to these entities.\n\nThe administrative requirements for MTT and DTT are administered under a self-assessment system in Singapore. This means that the filing process for MTT and DTT will be treated as complete without a need for IRAS to assess the tax and issue a notice of assessment.\n\nIRAS may select MTT and DTT returns filed by taxpayers for audit as part of IRAS’ regular compliance reviews. If IRAS is of the view that the MTT or DTT declared is inaccurate, IRAS may issue a notice of assessment to revise the tax payable. If the MNE group disagrees with IRAS’ assessment, it can object to the assessment within two months of the service of the notice of assessment.\n\nThe UPE of an MNE group that has a CE or a JV located in Singapore or a reverse hybrid entity formed, registered or incorporated in Singapore (not being a responsible member) must notify the Comptroller of the MNE group’s liability to be registered under the MMT Act. The registration is a one-time process, and the registration form will be available digitally. The registration must be made within six months after the first FYE of the UPE where MTT or DTT, or both, applies to the MNE group (or such extended time as the Comptroller may allow).\n\nThe MNE group will be required to designate a single Singapore CE to be the DFE and GFE to fulfil tax obligations in Singapore. The same CE will be designated as the DFE and GFE. The rules in determining the DFE and GFE of an MNE group are set out below:\n\nWhere the UPE is a legal entity located in Singapore, and is not an excluded entity, the UPE is the DFE/GFE.\n\nOtherwise, an intermediate parent entity that is a legal entity located in Singapore, is the parent entity of all other Singapore CEs and is not an excluded entity, is the DFE/GFE.\n\nIf there is no such UPE/IPE, any CE in Singapore can be designated as the DFE/GFE if the designated CE is a legal entity located in Singapore, or if no such legal entity exists, a permanent establishment located in Singapore (including a branch of a foreign company registered in Singapore).\n\nWhere the MNE group does not have a CE that meets the above requirements, the Comptroller must deem a CE of the MNE group located in Singapore, a joint venture or JV subsidiary located in Singapore and connected to the MNE group or a reverse hybrid entity of the MNE group, to be the DFE/GFE.\n\nThe appointment of the DFE/GFE must be made within six months after the first FYE of the UPE where MTT or DTT, or both, applies to the MNE group (or such extended time as the Comptroller may allow). The first appointment of the DFE/GFE is made together with the registration of the MNE group.\n\nIf the DFE/GFE no longer exists or no longer belongs to the group, the UPE must inform the Comptroller of the new DFE/GFE no later than a month after the DFE/GFE ceases to be a part of the group or such extended time as the Comptroller may allow.\n\nThe MNE group will be required to designate another Singapore CE as the new DFE/GFE. The newly appointed DFE/GFE will be required to carry out any duty of the previous DFE/GFE that has yet to be fulfilled as at the date of new appointment.\n\nThe table below sets out the key timelines for MTT and DTT, and the entity responsible for fulfilling the respective obligations:\n\nAll registered MNE groups liable for MTT and/or DTT are required to file tax returns on their top-up tax liability in Singapore. The filing of tax returns for MTT and DTT will be available in digital service.\n\nThe GIR is a standardised information return required under the GloBE rules. By default, every Singapore CE of an MNE group will have an obligation to file a GIR with IRAS, regardless of where the MNE group is headquartered. The GFE of a registered MNE group in Singapore is required to file the GIR annually with IRAS on behalf of its represented entities in Singapore. The format and requirements of the GIR will be based on the document titled “Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy – GloBE Information Return” issued by the IF on 17 July 2023.\n\nA foreign CE, such as the UPE of a foreign MNE group, may file a GIR centrally in a foreign jurisdiction. Where a GIR has been filed in another jurisdiction outside Singapore and Singapore has an information exchange agreement with that foreign jurisdiction to receive the GIR, the GFE in Singapore will not be required to file a GIR with IRAS. However, the GFE will still be required to file a GloBE notification annually with IRAS. The notification will inform IRAS of the identity of the filing CE (e.g. the foreign UPE) and where the GIR is filed. This is to facilitate the transmission of the GIR to IRAS via automatic exchange of information.\n\nThe parent entity that is a responsible member located in Singapore, the DFE and the GFE are responsible for submitting the MTT return, DTT return and GIR/GloBE notification respectively.\n\nThe due date for submission of the MTT and DTT returns and the GIR/GloBE notification will be 15 months after the end of each FY (or 18 months if the FY is a transition year). If the MTT or DTT returns are not submitted by the filing due date, IRAS may estimate the MTT or DTT payable and issue a notice of assessment.\n\nIf an MNE group chooses to file its GIR centrally in an implementing jurisdiction according to Article 8.1.2 of the GloBE Model Rules, the information in the GIR will be disseminated to other implementing jurisdictions where the MNE group is operating in based on an approach that has been agreed by the IF. The IF has adopted the following targeted dissemination approach for sharing the GIR of each MNE group.\n\nThe record-keeping periods for MTT and DTT are as follows:\n\nThe records to be kept for MTT and DTT purposes are generally aligned with the records to be kept for CIT or accounting purposes. Examples of records are general ledgers, invoices, accounting records and schedules, bank statements and pre-consolidated accounts.\n\nAn extended record-keeping period is applicable to supporting documents substantiating the calculation of the provisions in the GloBE rules that require looking back at the MNE group’s past years’ figures. In such cases, the supporting documents are to be kept for up to ten years (i.e. beyond the general record keeping period of five years). The extended record keeping period is required for IRAS to verify the accuracy of the computations done by the MNE group.\n\nThe statutory time limits to raise an assessment for MTT and DTT are as follows:\n\nThe parent entity that is a responsible member located in Singapore and the DFE are responsible for the payment of MTT and DTT respectively.\n\nFor DTT purpose, the DFE can elect under section 45 of the MMT Act to have a qualifying entity in the group to be allocated a share of the MNE group’s DTT liability. An MNE group can elect up to 30 CEs for any FY.\n\nIf the election is made, the qualifying entity will be responsible for payment of the allocated share to IRAS and the DFE will be liable to pay the remaining MNE group’s DTT. The election can be made on a yearly basis at the point of filing the DTT return and is irrevocable for that FY.\n\nThe due date for payment of MTT and DTT is no later than one month after the filing due date of the MTT and DTT return respectively. Where the Comptroller issues a notice of assessment, the due date for payment of the MTT or DTT is within one month after the service of the notice.\n\nWhere MTT or DTT has been computed in a currency other than Singapore dollars, the tax payable in foreign currency needs to be converted into Singapore dollars for payment to IRAS. The exchange rate to be used is the average exchange rate, as made available by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, calculated on the basis of the rate of exchange at the end of each month for that FY.\n\nThe time periods for the repayment of MTT and DTT and the claiming of relief for error or mistake in respect of an MTT and DTT return, are aligned with the statutory time limits for MTT and DTT assessments respectively.\n\nA claim for repayment, or an application for relief, must be made no later than:\n\nThe UPE of a registered MNE group must inform the Comptroller of the following events:\n\nPenalties (including composition amounts or fines) and/or surcharges may be imposed under the MMT Act where an in-scope MNE group fails to meet its obligations for MTT and DTT. Some of the key obligations have been highlighted.\n\nMTT and DTT are taxes charged on the income of an MNE group. They are not incurred in the production of income. Thus, they are not deductible for CIT purposes in Singapore, under section 15(1)(g) of the ITA.\n\nAny qualified IIR, qualified UTPR and QDMTT or taxes substantially similar to these taxes are not allowed for tax deduction for CIT purposes in Singapore.\n\nQualified IIR, qualified UTPR and QDMTT refer to taxes imposed by the law of another jurisdiction that are prescribed by the Minister in the regulations as being equivalent in effect as the MTT, tax imposed by the UTPR in the GloBE rules, and DTT respectively.\n\nIn terms of rule order, qualified IIR and qualified UTPR (or substantially similar taxes) imposed by other jurisdictions (“foreign GloBE taxes”) are to be imposed after the application of CIT in Singapore. Allowing a deduction for foreign GloBE taxes for CIT purposes would thus create circularity in the charging of CIT under the ITA. Tax deduction is therefore not allowed on such amounts.\n\nA QDMTT is a form of tax on income, as the tax base in the computation of QDMTT is premised on the entity’s accounting profits (i.e. income). Hence, similar to DTT, QDMTT (or substantially similar taxes) imposed by other jurisdictions, are disallowed for tax deduction for CIT purposes in Singapore.\n\nFor CIT purposes in Singapore, FTC may be allowed on foreign DMTT paid or payable on income of a foreign permanent establishment whose main entity is a Singapore CE or income of a foreign dividend-paying company, out of which dividend is paid to entities resident in Singapore.\n\nFor the Singapore CE to qualify for FTC claims in Singapore on foreign DMTT paid or payable, the following conditions must be met:\n\nFor dividend income derived by the Singapore CE, the FTC will take into account the underlying tax paid by the dividend-paying company in the foreign jurisdiction.\n\nFor the purpose of granting the FTC, the portion of foreign DMTT in respect of which FTC may be allowed must be clearly attributed to the remitted (or deemed remitted) income. If there is no clear attribution of the taxes to the remitted (or deemed remitted) income, no FTC will be allowed.\n\nFTC will not be allowed for foreign GloBE taxes for CIT purposes in Singapore. In terms of rule order, foreign GloBE taxes are to be imposed after the application of income tax. Providing FTC in Singapore for foreign GloBE taxes creates circularity, since the foreign GloBE taxes are determined after taking into account the income tax payable (net of FTC) of the Singapore CE. In addition, the foreign GloBE taxes are payable by a parent entity and not by the entity who derives the income.\n\nUnder the FSIE scheme, foreign-sourced dividends, foreign branch profits and foreign sourced service income received by resident taxpayers in Singapore are exempt from tax if all the following conditions are met:\n\nWhen determining whether the “subject to tax” condition is met under FSIE and FTC pooling system, foreign DMTT paid in a foreign jurisdiction in respect of specified foreign income will be considered as meeting the “subject to tax” condition, in alignment with the position taken to treat foreign DMTT as a tax paid or payable in respect of income; and foreign GloBE taxes will not be considered to meet the “subject to tax” condition, as these taxes are not eligible for FTC.\n\nIf the highest corporate tax rate of a foreign jurisdiction of source in the year the foreign income is remitted (or deemed remitted to Singapore) from that foreign jurisdiction is at least 15%, the “foreign headline tax rate of at least 15%” condition for FSIE and FTC pooling system is considered to be met.\n\nAny request for clarification on the e-Tax guide can be sent to IRAS_Pillar_Two@iras.gov.sg.",

        "text": "{'content': 'This guide provides an overview of corporate income tax in Singapore, including the key features and obligations for companies. Corporate income tax is a tax on the profits of companies, levied on the income earned by companies in Singapore. The current corporate income tax rate in Singapore is 17%. Certain companies may qualify for tax exemptions or incentives, which can reduce their effective tax rate. Companies are required to file their corporate income tax returns annually, typically by November 30 for the preceding financial year. Tax payments are due within one month after the Notice of Assessment is issued. Understanding corporate income tax is crucial for compliance and effective financial planning for companies operating in Singapore. You are still required to file the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C for the YA immediately after the year of incorporation, even if you have not received any filing notification. For such cases, please fill out the Request for Income Tax Return for Newly Incorporated Companies. If your company closes its first set of accounts on December 31, 2023, and commences business or receives income in 2023, you are required to file the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C for YA 2024 by November 30, 2024. This is only applicable for newly incorporated companies. Singapore branches of foreign companies will be issued the Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C filing notifications after the first year of business. For example, if your branch is registered in Singapore in 2023, you will receive your first Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C filing notification for YA 2024 by May 2024. Local companies with UEN must use the correct tax reference number to file their company’s ECI and Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C. You may refer to our Basic Corporate Income Tax Calculator for assistance in preparing your company’s tax computation and supporting schedules when filing its Corporate Income Tax Returns. It is not a requirement to engage a tax agent or consultant to prepare and file your company’s ECI and Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C with IRAS. Various service channels will give you a better understanding of your company’s tax filing obligations and assist you in the filing of ECI and Form C-S/ Form C-S (Lite)/ Form C with IRAS. You must maintain proper records of your financial transactions and retain the source documents, accounting records, and schedules for at least 5 years from the relevant Year of Assessment. Access the New Company Start-Up Kit, an interactive e-Learning guide, to learn more about your Corporate Income Tax filing obligations. Company representatives responsible for the preparation and filing of the Corporate Income Tax Returns and other Corporate Income Tax matters are encouraged to watch our e-Learning videos. The first Year of Assessment of your company is the YA that relates to the basis period during which your company is incorporated. The basis period is generally a 12-month period preceding the YA. If your company’s first set of accounts covers a period of more than 12 months from the date of incorporation, its profit/losses must be attributed and declared under 2 YAs. Generally, expenses incurred before your business commences are not tax-deductible. However, revenue expenses incurred 1 year prior to the deemed date of commencement of business are deductible for tax purposes.

Companies must settle all outstanding tax liabilities with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) before applying for strike off with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). If a company has ceased business and filed the necessary tax returns, it is not required to file an Estimated Chargeable Income (ECI) for the relevant Year of Assessment. If IRAS objects to a strike off application due to outstanding tax matters, the company must resolve these issues within two months.

        "text": "{'content': \"Donations to approved charities can receive tax deductions. The deduction amount depends on the donation type and amount. Cash donations are eligible for a tax deduction of 2.5 times the donated amount, while in-kind donations are based on the market value of the items donated. To qualify for these deductions, donations must be made to charities registered with the Commissioner of Charities. Donors need to provide documentation, such as receipts, to claim the deduction. For more details, refer to the official guidelines from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. Donations made to approved Institutions of a Public Character (IPC) for local causes are tax deductible. However, if a donor receives a benefit in return for their donation, the deduction is only on the amount exceeding the value of the benefit. Donations of shares, artefacts, and under specific schemes like the public art tax incentive scheme are also eligible for deductions. Non-tax deductible donations include those made to charities that are not approved IPCs or donations of goods not listed as deductible. Contributions governed by agreements with refund clauses or exclusivity clauses do not qualify as tax deductible donations. Tax deductions can be carried forward for up to five years if they exceed the donor's income for the year. Donations of immovable properties and shares to approved IPCs are exempt from stamp duty.

                "processed_text": "Guidance on Tax Deductible Donations\n\nThis e-Tax Guide sets out what contributions made to an Institution of A Public Character (IPC) or a Grant-Making Philanthropic Organisation (Grant-maker) are considered donations and eligible for tax deduction under the Income Tax Act 1947 (ITA); and the differences between donations and sponsorships.\n\nThis e-Tax Guide will be relevant to you if you are an IPC, a Grant-maker, or a potential donor.\n\nIPCs and Grant-makers may use this guide to determine whether the contribution which they receive should (a) be regarded as a donation or sponsorship, and (b) if the contribution is considered a donation, whether the donation qualifies for enhanced tax deduction for income tax purposes. IPCs should read this e-Tax Guide in conjunction with the e-Tax Guide on Tax Treatment on Donations with Benefits, which deals with the specific scenario where donors receive benefits when they make tax deductible donations.\n\nGlossary\n\nInstitution of A Public Character as defined under section 40 of the Charities Act 1994: A registered charity or an exempt charity in Singapore that is approved as an institution of a public character by the Minister, Commissioner of Charities, or any Sector Administrator on the application of the charity; or which is deemed as an institution of a public character under any written law.\n\nGrant-making Philanthropic Organisation: A grant-making philanthropic organisation registered with IRAS under the Income Tax (Grant-Making Philanthropic Organisations) Regulations 2009.\n\nHereinafter, references to IPC(s) in this guide should be taken to include the references to Grant-makers.\n\nBackground\n\nTo encourage philanthropy and altruistic giving, the Government provides enhanced tax deductions on certain donations made to IPCs (“tax deductible donations”) under section 37(3) of the ITA. For the donors to enjoy the enhanced tax deductions on their donations, IPCs are required to issue tax deduction receipts to the donors. As granting such enhanced tax deduction results in tax revenue foregone by the Government, IPCs must ensure that tax deduction receipts are issued only in respect of tax deductible donations.\n\nIPCs may source for donations and sponsorships to fund their activities. When a person contributes to an IPC, the person may receive enhanced income tax deduction in respect of the contribution if the contribution is a donation that met the relevant conditions. When the person’s contribution to the IPC is a sponsorship, the person is not entitled to enhanced income tax deduction, and IPCs should not issue tax deduction receipts for such contributions. Instead, the sponsors may claim these sponsorships as business expenses when they file their income tax returns if these expenses were tax deductible expenses under section 14 of the ITA (i.e. revenue expenses incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of their income).\n\nWhat is a Donation\n\nA donation is generally an unconditional and voluntary gift to the recipient without expectation of any benefit in return. The main test determining whether a contribution is a donation depends on the intention of the person making the contribution. If a person would not have made the contribution to an IPC but for the fact that he would receive a benefit-in-return, the contribution to the IPC would not be considered a donation. That said, the fact that a person receives a benefit-in-return in connection with his contribution to an IPC does not automatically mean that his contribution is not a donation. Whether a contribution constitutes a donation will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. This e-Tax Guide highlights some factors which would disqualify a contribution from being regarded as a donation, as well as some illustrative examples on what constitutes a donation.\n\nTax Deductibility of Donations\n\nThe following three criteria can be used by IPCs to determine if a contribution qualifies as a tax deductible donation:\n\na) The contribution must fall within one of the categories of donation specified in section 37(3)(c), (e) and (f) of the ITA as detailed in Annex A;\n\nb) The contribution is a free-will gift for which the giver relinquishes and confers all his rights, control and ownership over the gift to the IPC when the contribution is made;\n\nc) If the contribution is subject to any condition specified by the donor as to the purpose for which the contribution may be applied, all the three requirements under section 37(3C) of the ITA must be satisfied.\n\nIPCs may issue tax deduction receipts to donors in respect of tax deductible donations that meet all the above three criteria. Where a contribution does not fulfil any of the three criteria above, the contribution is not a tax deductible donation and IPCs must not issue tax deduction receipts in respect of the contribution.\n\nA contribution will not qualify as a tax deductible donation if the contribution is governed by an agreement which includes any of the following attributes and IPCs must not issue tax deduction receipts in respect of such contributions:\n\na) The contribution agreement contains a refund clause, where the IPC is obliged to refund (wholly or in part) the contribution or make other compensation arrangements to the contributor;\n\nb) The contribution agreement contains an ‘exclusivity’ clause which prevents the IPC from accepting funds/contributions from and/or acknowledging other contributors/donors, regardless of whether the latter are from the same industry as the contributor;\n\nc) The contribution arrangement is in substance a commercial arrangement or an exchange of monies for benefits. Such arrangements include outright sales of goods or services, instances where the contributor derives substantial commercial benefits from the contribution arrangement, or instances where the contributor retains contractual rights over the sum contributed.\n\nContributions made under agreements with these attributes will not qualify as tax deductible donations as the contributions would not be consistent with a free-will gift where the contributor relinquishes and confers all his rights, control and ownership over the gift to the IPC when the contribution is made.\n\nRefund clause vs statutory obligation to refund\n\nWhile Regulation 11(7) of the Charities (Institutions of A Public Character) Regulations requires an IPC to return the donated funds if it is unable to carry out the project for which it has specifically raised funds for, this is a statutory obligation, and does not impose a requirement on the IPC to include a refund clause in the contribution agreement. The inclusion of a refund clause in the contribution agreement indicates that the contribution is not a free-will gift as it creates a contractual obligation that is commercial in nature. Such a contribution agreement would thus be classified as a sponsorship and would not be eligible for enhanced tax deductions.\n\nIPCs should refer to the IPC Regulations for the legal requirements and circumstances under which the obligation under Reg 11(7) applies. For avoidance of doubt, a clause where the IPC commits to adhere to the IPC Regulations does not constitute a refund clause. To assure donors that IPCs are adhering to their statutory obligations regarding the donations, IPCs may wish to refer donors to the IPC Regulations.\n\nDonations with benefits\n\nWhere a donor, or a person connected with the donor, receives a benefit in return for a tax deductible donation made, the enhanced tax deduction is only granted on the difference between the donation and the value of the benefit under section 37(3G) of the ITA. Enhanced tax deduction will not be granted if the contribution is ascertained to be a sponsorship.\n\nNotwithstanding the rule, to further encourage philanthropic giving, certain donations made to IPC may be deemed to be pure donations as a concession, notwithstanding there is a benefit given in return for the donation. These benefits are treated as having no commercial value under the concessionary tax treatment outlined in the e-Tax Guide on Tax Treatment on Donations with Benefits.\n\nWhat is a Sponsorship\n\nSponsorships (whether in-kind or in cash) are arrangements which typically entail a defined set of rights, opportunities, and benefits to the sponsor to be fulfilled by the IPC in exchange for the sponsorship monies. The sponsor will typically support an activity or event by making a contribution to the IPC and in the process, the sponsor receives certain commercial benefits, although the value of the benefits could be lower than the value of the support provided. This is unlike a donation where the intent is to make an unconditional and voluntary gift to the IPC without expectation of any benefit in return, to support its charitable objects.\n\nIf a contributor would not have made the contribution but for the fact that he would receive a benefit in return, regardless of whether the value of the contribution is higher than the value of the benefits received (i.e. the contribution is not a free-will gift), the full contribution would not be a donation. Whether the contribution made to an IPC tantamount to a sponsorship ultimately depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.\n\nTax Deductibility of Sponsorships\n\nSponsorships are not eligible for enhanced tax deduction under section 37(3) of the ITA. Such sponsorships of monies, goods or services may, however, be expenses allowable for tax deduction under section 144 of the ITA if such expenses are considered as being incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income and are not explicitly prohibited under section 155 of the ITA. These include payments made to advertise the sponsor’s goods and services. Sponsors may claim these sponsorship expenses when they file their income tax returns.\n\nIPCs should determine whether a contribution is a sponsorship or a donation by reviewing the terms of the agreement with the contributor and bearing in mind the principles and factors set out in paragraphs 6.1 and 6.3 above. IPCs should not issue tax deduction receipts for sponsorships. IPCs should also take note that the tax treatments stated in the e-Tax Guide on Tax Treatment on Donations with Benefits apply only to donations and not sponsorships.\n\nIn the event of wrongful issuance of tax deduction receipts, the enhanced tax deductions claimed by the sponsors will be recovered by IRAS and the IPCs may be liable for penalties imposed by the Commissioner of Charities.\n\nEnquiries\n\nFor enquiries or clarification on this e-Tax Guide, please contact:\n\nTel: 6351 3763\nEmail: charities@iras.gov.sg\n\nAnnex A – Details of the three criteria under paragraph 5.2 and examples of non-qualifying donations\n\na) The donation must fall within one of the categories of donation specified in section 37(3)(c), (e) and (f) of the ITA.\n\nQualified Recipients\n• IPC\n• Singapore Government\n• Grant-making Philanthropic Organisation (registered by the Comptroller of Income Tax)\n\nTypes of Donations\nCash\nShares and units in unit trusts donated by any individual\n- Shares must be of a company listed on Singapore Exchange\n- Units in unit trust must be traded in Singapore or listed on the Singapore Exchange\nImmovable property\n\nDonations-in-kind do not constitute tax deductible donations except as provided under S37(3)(b), S37(3)(e) and S37(3)(f) of the ITA.\n\nExamples of non-qualifying donations:\n\nExample 1\nA florist donates its inventory of plants and flowers to an IPC to be used at a fund-raising event. As the donated items do not fall within the above list, they do not qualify as tax deductible donations.\n\nExample 2\nUnder a deed of arrangement, an IPC is allowed to use a piece of land for 50 years with no premium or rent payable to the landowner. This free use of land is not a tax deductible donation.\n\nb) The donation is a free-will gift for which the contributor relinquishes and confers all his rights, control and ownership over the gift to a qualified recipient when the donation is made.\n\nExamples of non-qualifying donations:\n\nExample 3\nA company pledges or promises to give $500,000 to an IPC. The pledge or promise itself does not constitute a donation since no money is transferred to the IPC yet. A donation is made only when the company honours the pledge by transferring the money to the IPC.\n\nContributions with a refund clause\n\nExample 4\nA company gives $1 million to an IPC with the condition that the amount, wholly or in part, be refunded to them if the amount was not utilised by the IPC for the agreed objective. While Regulation 11(7) of the IPC Regulations requires an IPC to return the donated funds if it was not utilised for the intended objectives, the inclusion of a refund clause creates a contractual obligation which is commercial in nature. Such a contribution agreement would be classified as a sponsorship and cannot qualify as a tax deductible donation.\n\nOn the other hand, if the IPC states in the agreement that it commits to adhere to all relevant laws, rules and legislations, including but not limited to Regulation 11(7) of the IPC Regulations, this clause itself does not constitute a refund clause and this factor alone will not disqualify the contribution as a tax deductible donation.\n\nExample 5\nA company gives $20 million to an IPC with the condition that the amount, wholly or in part, be refunded to them if: (a) IRAS determines that the $20 million does not qualify for enhanced tax deduction, or (b) certain benefits which were agreed upon were not given to the company. As the gift is subject to refund conditions, the $20 million cannot qualify as a tax deductible donation.\n\nContributions with an exclusivity clause\n\nExample 6\nA company gives $500,000 to an IPC on the condition that the IPC cannot enter into an agreement with another company for any form of sponsorship. As the gift imposes an exclusivity condition on the IPC, it is not an outright donation and does not qualify as a tax deductible donation. This is a sponsorship arrangement.\n\nContribution is a commercial arrangement in substance\n\nA pure gift of money or asset cannot be treated as a tax deductible donation if it forms a prerequisite for a subsequent commercial collaboration with the contributor or any person connected to the contributor, or if it is associated with any business arrangement involving the acquisition of goods or services by the IPC from the contributor or any person connected to the contributor. The entire arrangement constitutes a business arrangement or sponsorship, rather than a donation.\n\nExample 7\nIn return for a cash payment of $300,000 over a time period from a gaming software distributor, a university allows the distributor to advertise its gaming software at the school compound during its freshmen orientation week. The advertisements take the forms of setting up booths and displaying of distributor’s banners, products and other collaterals at the school. If the university does not fulfil this obligation, the gaming software distributor will terminate any outstanding payments. Such a cash payment does not qualify as a tax deductible donation as the substance of the arrangement is that of commercial transaction and it is not a free-will gift. The sum of $300,000 should be more appropriately classified as a sponsorship.\n\nExample 8\nA production company makes a cash gift to an IPC and in return for the contribution, is awarded with exclusive rights to either produce or collaborate with the IPC to produce new media, arts performance, film, etc. Where the exclusive rights are contingent on the cash gift made, the cash gift then forms part of a business arrangement or sponsorship and is not a tax deductible donation.\n\nExample 9\nA company makes a contribution of $500,000 to an IPC. In return for the contribution, the company is provided with many marketing, publicity, and promotional benefits, but these benefits are valued at $100,000. The company is entitled to receive some other form of compensation if these benefits are not delivered fully. The entire contribution does not qualify as a tax deductible donation as the overall facts of the case indicate that the transaction is commercial in nature. The contribution is therefore a form of sponsorship.\n\nExample 10\nA company makes a contribution of $50,000 to an IPC to set up a scholarship. As part of the conditions for receiving the scholarship, the recipient is required to provide a list of services for the company. The contribution is substantially a commercial transaction similar to a service contract. The contribution is therefore a sponsorship.\n\nExample of qualifying donation:\n\nExample 11\nA company makes a contribution of $500,000 to an IPC. In return for the contribution, the company is given free tickets to a performance staged by the IPC. The IPC is not restricted from accepting contributions from other donors or acknowledging contributions made by other companies in the same sector/industry. The IPC prints all its donors’ logos in its publicity banners and pamphlets as a form of acknowledgement. The company is not entitled to any refund of the contribution even if the IPC does not deliver any of the benefits it had earlier agreed to provide (e.g. there are no contractual clauses that indicate any refunds or compensations to be made to the company in the event that the performance is cancelled). The contribution qualifies as a tax deductible donation. While the company receives benefits in the form of free tickets for the performance, these benefits are treated as having no commercial value under the concessionary tax treatment.\n\nc) The donation is an outright gift or if the donation is subject to any condition specified by the donor as to the purpose for which the donation may be applied, all the three requirements under section 37(3C) of the ITA must be satisfied.\n\nThe following two types of donations to an IPC – an outright donation and a donation for a specified purpose are qualifying donations.\n\nOutright donation\nAn outright donation is an unconditional gift where the donor fully transfers both the ownership and control over the use of the donation to the IPC without stating any specified purpose as to how the donation should be used.\n\nDonations for specified purposes\nA donor may place legally enforceable conditions on how the IPC can use donation made. Such donations are tax deductible if (and only if) all the three requirements under section 37(3C) of the ITA are satisfied:\n(a) Each specified purpose must be one that advances an objective of the recipient set out in its governing instrument;\n(b) None of the specified purposes must be to advance the interests (whether directly or indirectly) of a particular race, belief or religion, or of a particular person or persons; and\n(c) The donor did not specify or imply in any manner that any part of the property or money that cannot be used for any of the specified purposes shall revert to him or be given to any other person.\n\nExample of non-qualifying donation:\n\nExample 12\nA family donates monies to an IPC on the condition that the IPC awards a scholarship under its education support program to a specified relative or person. As one of the specified purpose is to advance the interest of a particular person, it does not satisfy section 37(3C)(b) of the ITA. This donation is thus not tax deductible.\n\nExample of qualifying donation:\n\nExample 13\nAn individual makes a cash donation to a hospital (which is an IPC) and stipulates that the monies be applied only to senior citizens above the age of 70 years old for their medical needs. In this example, the condition imposed by the donor advances the charitable objects of the hospital. The condition also does not favour any named persons or a group of people based on race, belief or religion. The beneficiaries of the donation are a class of persons, and not “particular persons” who are specified to receive the benefits; and thus the donation does not breach condition (b). Hence, this donation for a specified purpose is tax deductible as it meets all the requirements under section 37(3C) of the ITA.",

However, where the donor receives a benefit in return for the donation made, the tax deduction is only granted on the difference between the donation and the cost of benefit.\n\n2.2 Similarly, for GST purpose, a donation is not subject to GST where the recipient of donation does not provide any benefit to the donor in return for the donation. Where the recipient of donation provides some benefits to the donor in return for a donation, all or part of the donation is considered to be payment in return for goods or services. GST is to be accounted by the recipient of donation on such consideration if the recipient of donation is GST-registered.\n\n3 Concessionary Tax Treatment – Donations With Certain Benefits\n\n3.1 IRAS has reviewed the tax treatment of donations with benefits. To further encourage philanthropic giving, as a concession, certain donations made to registered charities and institutions of a public character (IPCs) will be deemed to be pure donations notwithstanding there is a benefit given in return for the donation. To qualify for the concessionary tax treatment, donations with benefits given in return will be regarded as pure donations if the benefits are treated as having no commercial value. Benefits are treated as having no commercial value if the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) the benefit is given in acknowledgement of the donation; and\n\n(b) the benefit has no resale value\n\n3.2 The table below lists the common benefits given in return for donations, wherein IRAS will now deem the donations as pure donations for which the concessionary tax treatment is applicable.\n\nTypes of Benefits\n\nWhether Benefit is Considered to have a Commercial Value\n\nNo\n\nCharity dinners where the donation includes ticket to attend dinner\n\nIncome Tax Treatment\n\nGST Treatment\n\nTax deduction on the full amount donated is allowed to the donor.\n\nNo GST needs to be accounted by the recipient of donation.\n\nTax deduction on the full amount donated is allowed to the donor.\n\nNo GST needs to be accounted by the recipient of donation.\n\nTax deduction on the full amount donated is allowed to the donor.\n\nNo GST needs to be accounted by the recipient of donation.\n\nTax deduction on the full amount donated is allowed to the donor.\n\nNo GST needs to be accounted by the recipient of donation.\n\nWhere the souvenirs or gifts are commercially available, tax deduction on the difference between the amount donated and the price of the souvenir or gift is allowed to the donor.\n\nWhere the souvenirs or gifts are commercially available, GST is to be accounted by the recipient of donation on the price of the souvenir or gift.\n\nCharity shows where the donation includes ticket to attend show\n\nComplimentary tickets (e.g. entry to Singapore Zoo)\n\nGolf tournament where donation includes golf game for donor\n\nSouvenir or gift (e.g. plaques, commemorative books, CDs, goodie bags, etc)\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo, except where such souvenir or gift is sold commercially.

                "processed_text": "Tax Treatment of Donations with Benefits\n\nThis e-Tax Guide sets out the concessionary tax treatment applicable for cash donations with certain types of benefits received in return, where the donations are made on or after 19 March 2021. This guide is only applicable for donations, a voluntary gift where the donor’s contribution is not motivated by a benefit-in-return.\n\nThis e-Tax Guide will be relevant to you if you are an Institution of a Public Character (IPC) or a registered charity.\n\nWhen a donor receives a benefit in return for the donation made to an IPC, a 2.5 times tax deduction is granted only on the difference between the donation and the value of the benefit, and GST is to be accounted for by the recipient of the donation. However, IRAS applies an administrative concession to certain benefits that are given out in connection with a fundraising activity and are deemed to have no commercial value. As a result, the donor receives a 2.5 times tax deduction on the full amount of his donation, and the recipient of the donation does not have to account for GST on the benefit given.\n\nThis list of benefits is exhaustive; the concession does not apply to benefits outside of this list. Some common benefits that are not eligible for the concessionary tax treatment are laid out in the guide. An outright sale of goods and services is not regarded as a bona fide donation. Consequently, the 2.5 times tax deduction would not be allowed for such transactions for income tax purposes. Similarly, GST is to be accounted for on the total consideration received for the sale of goods or services.\n\nIPCs are to note the above tax treatment in conducting their fundraising activities.\n\nAn Institution of a Public Character (IPC) is a registered charity or an exempt charity in Singapore that is approved as an institution of a public character under the Charities Act on the application of the charity or which is deemed as an institution of a public character under any written law. A registered charity is a charity registered with the Commissioner of Charities under section 5 of the Charities Act. The recipient of a donation refers to both IPCs and registered charities.\n\nIPCs and registered charities may organize different types of fundraising activities. Examples include charity golf games, gala dinners, or charity shows. Typically, donors who made donations of certain amounts will be entitled to participate in these activities and may also receive other benefits such as souvenirs, meals, or entertainment in the course of these events.\n\nUnder section 37(3) of the Income Tax Act, a tax deduction at 2.5 times of the donation amount is granted in respect of cash donations to IPCs. However, where the donor receives a benefit in return for the donation made, the tax deduction is only granted on the difference between the donation and the value of the benefit.\n\nSimilarly, for GST purposes, a donation is not subject to GST where the recipient of the donation does not provide any benefit to the donor in return for the donation. Where the recipient of the donation provides some benefits to the donor in return for a donation, all or part of the donation is considered as payment in return for goods or services. GST is to be accounted for by the recipient of the donation on such consideration if the recipient of the donation is GST-registered.\n\nTo support philanthropic giving and to ease compliance, IRAS has been applying an administrative concession to donations with benefits since 2006. Under the concession, IRAS deems certain donations with benefits received in return as pure donations, provided the benefits given fall within a specified list of benefits. Such benefits specified in the list are treated as having no commercial value. The donor will enjoy a tax deduction on the full amount of cash donations, and no GST needs to be accounted for by the recipient either. IRAS has reviewed this administrative concession and is updating the concessionary tax treatment with effect from 19 March 2021 after consultation with IPCs, sector administrators, and the Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth (MCCY).\n\nTo qualify for the concessionary tax treatment, donations with benefits given in return will be regarded as pure donations if the benefits are treated as having no commercial value. To be treated as having no commercial value, the benefits must be given out in connection with a fundraising activity and fall within the list of benefits specified in the guide.\n\nWhere the benefit given falls outside the specified list, the tax deduction will be granted after netting off the market value of the benefits. GST will also have to be accounted for on the market value of the benefits.\n\nThe table lists the common benefits given in return for donations, wherein IRAS will deem the donations as pure donations for which the concessionary tax treatment is applicable. \n\nExamples of benefits that qualify for concession include charity gala dinners, charity shows, golf tournaments, not-intended-for-resale complimentary tickets, and souvenirs or gifts. Tax deduction on the full amount donated is allowed to the donor, and no GST needs to be accounted for by the recipient of the donation.\n\nIncidental benefits refer to benefits that are given as part and parcel of a fundraising event and are not intended for resale. Not-intended-for-resale refers to items that fulfill certain conditions, such as having an indication that it is “not-for-sale” or not being in a form or packaging that is typically sold commercially.\n\nFor lucky draws held as part of a fundraising event, if the top prize is at or under the $2,000 threshold, the donor will enjoy a tax deduction on the full donation, and no GST needs to be accounted for on the lucky draw. However, if the value of the top prize exceeds $2,000, the administrative concession will not apply, and no tax deduction will be allowed on any amount donated.\n\nFor fundraising events that fall outside the specified categories, the concessionary treatment will generally not apply. Under such a scenario, no income tax deduction will be given on the donation, and GST has to be accounted for on the market value of all benefits given in the fundraising event, including the lucky draw prizes.\n\nFor standalone lucky draws, contributions that give donors a right to participate are regarded as payments made in return for the chance to participate and win prizes in the lucky draws. As they are not pure donations, no tax deduction will be allowed on any amount donated.\n\nFor all other benefits given in return for donations, the current tax treatment of allowing tax deduction on the difference between the donation and the value of the benefits given, as well as imposing GST on the Open Market Value of the benefits accruing to the donor, continues to be applicable.\n\nAn IPC or registered charity that merely acknowledges a donor for its donations will not be considered as having conferred a benefit to the donor. IRAS will consider an acknowledgement as such if all of the specified conditions are satisfied.\n\nWhere necessary, the market value/price of the benefits may be determined using various methods, including retail price, retail price of a comparable benefit, opinion of experts, or cost to the IPC/registered charity for providing the benefit.\n\nFor enquiries or clarification on this e-Tax Guide, please contact the relevant departments at IRAS. \n\nAnnex A provides a table illustrating tax treatment with lucky draws held as part of a fundraising event, while Annex B contains frequently asked questions regarding various scenarios related to donations and benefits.",

It aims to combat tax evasion and ensure tax compliance. Developed by the OECD and endorsed by G20 countries, the CRS requires participating countries to collect information from financial institutions and exchange it annually with other jurisdictions. Over 100 jurisdictions have committed to implementing the CRS, including major financial centers like Dubai, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. In Singapore, the CRS has been in effect since September 2018, and financial institutions must register with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) and report account information accurately and timely. The CRS also includes amendments to cover new financial assets and enhance reporting outcomes. Singapore signed the Addendum to the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in November 2024, with exchanges under the amended CRS expected to start by 2027.

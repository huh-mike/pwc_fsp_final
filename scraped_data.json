        "text": "{'content': \"The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has announced that over 1.9 million taxpayers will benefit from the No-Filing Service (NFS) for the tax season in 2025. This service simplifies the tax filing process for eligible individuals, allowing them to avoid filing income tax returns. To qualify for the NFS, taxpayers must have income solely from employment and not exceed a certain threshold. IRAS will automatically assess their income and tax obligations based on available information. The NFS aims to reduce the administrative burden on taxpayers and streamline the tax assessment process. Eligible taxpayers will receive a notification from IRAS regarding their tax assessment, which they can review and accept without needing to file a return. This initiative is part of IRAS's efforts to enhance taxpayer experience and promote compliance with tax obligations in Singapore. Taxpayers on the NFS will receive a notification of their status by March 2025. They are reminded to verify pre-filled information in their return, especially for reliefs based on the previous year's tax bill, due to changes in criteria for dependant-related tax reliefs effective from YA 2025. The filing deadline for individual taxpayers and partnerships is 18 April 2025. Tax resident individuals will automatically receive a 60% rebate on tax payable, capped at $200. Close to 500,000 taxpayers will receive their tax bills earlier from mid-March 2025 through the Direct Notice of Assessment (D-NOA) initiative. Changes to dependant-related tax reliefs have been announced, including raising the income threshold for certain reliefs. The Working Mother’s Child Relief (WMCR) will also change to a fixed dollar amount for qualifying children born or adopted on or after 1 January 2024. Taxpayers are encouraged to use secured digital payment methods for tax payments and to be vigilant against scams. For assistance, taxpayers can contact IRAS through various channels, and more information is available on their website.\", 'urls': ['https://www.iras.gov.sg']}",

Exclude cash top-ups that attract matching grant from the Government under the Matched MediSave Scheme (“MMSS”) from CPF Cash Top-Up Relief\n\nTax resident CPF members may, subject to conditions, enjoy CPF Cash Top-Up Relief for cash top-ups made to their own or their eligible loved ones’ Retirement Account (“RA”) and / or Special Account (“SA”) (excluding any amount of cash top-ups that attract a matching grant under the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (“MRSS”)); and MediSave Account (“MA”). As the MMSS matching grant announced in Budget 2025 is already a significant benefit extended by the Government, cash top-ups made from 1 January 2026 to the MA of a MMSS-eligible CPF member that attract the MMSS matching grant will not entitle the giver to the CPF Cash Top-Up Relief from YA 2027. This also ensures parity with the current tax treatment for the MRSS, where cash top-ups to the RA or SA of an MRSS-eligible CPF member that attract the MRSS matching grant will not entitle the giver to the CPF Cash Top-Up Relief. A giver may continue to enjoy tax relief of up to $16,000 per year for eligible CPF cash top-ups that do not attract the MMSS or MRSS matching grant. The maximum amount of CPF Cash Top-Up Relief is $8,000 per year for cash top-ups to the giver’s own SA, RA or MA, and another $8,000 per year for cash top-ups to such accounts of the giver’s loved ones. For more information on the MMSS, please refer to Annex F-2.\n\n22. Allow the WHT concession for non-tax-resident arbitrators to lapse\n\nTo ensure parity in the treatment of income of non-tax-resident professionals, the concession for non-tax-resident arbitrators will be allowed to lapse after 31 December 2027. The Government will continue to support the international arbitration sector through a holistic suite of policies and initiatives.\n\n23. Allow the WHT concession for non-tax-resident mediators to lapse\n\nTo ensure parity in the treatment of income of non-tax-resident professionals, the concession for non-tax-resident mediators will be allowed to lapse after 31 December 2027. The Government will continue to support the commercial mediation sector through a holistic suite of policies and initiatives.\n\n24. Introduce the Additional Flat Component (“AFC”) of road tax for electric heavy goods vehicles (“HGVs”) and buses\n\nThe AFC is a lump-sum tax for electric cars, light goods vehicles, and motorcycles. Electric HGVs and buses currently do not pay AFC. For electric HGVs (goods vehicles with a Maximum Laden Weight > 3.5 metric tonnes) registered from 1 January 2026, the road tax schedule will include the following AFC: 6-monthly AFC $50 for the period from January 2026 to 31 December 2026, $75 for the period from 1 January 2027 to 31 December 2027, and $125 for the period from 1 January 2028 onwards. For electric buses with a Maximum Laden Weight ≤ 3.5 metric tonnes registered from 1 January 2026, the road tax schedule will include the following AFC: 6-monthly AFC $25 for the period from January 2026 to 31 December 2026, $50 for the period from 1 January 2027 to 31 December 2027, and $95 for the period from 1 January 2028 onwards. For electric buses with a Maximum Laden Weight >3.5 metric tonnes registered from 1 January 2026, the road tax schedule will include the following AFC: 6-monthly AFC $100 for the period from 1 January 2026 to 31 December 2026, $175 for the period from 1 January 2027 to 31 December 2027, and $275 for the period from 1 January 2028 onwards. For electric HGVs and buses registered up till 31 December 2025, AFC will be waived until 1 January 2029. There is no change to the other components of the road tax schedule for HGVs and buses.",

However, tax deductions can be claimed for reinstatement costs if they do not relate to provisions made under the Financial Reporting Standard 161, are contractually provided for in the tenancy agreement, and the premises are not vacated due to cessation of business. Tax deductions can be claimed for qualifying renovation or refurbishment expenses under Section 14N of the Income Tax Act 1947, but these do not qualify for capital allowances. The deduction applies to businesses carrying on a trade, business, or profession, but investment holding companies do not qualify.

This may not necessarily be the case when two related parties transact with each other. It is important to the integrity of the tax system that the price for the transaction between related parties approximates to the market price.\n\nTo prevent price distortion, tax authorities may audit the prices of transactions between related parties to verify if they are reflective of market prices. Such audit can lead to transfer pricing adjustments bringing about double taxation.\n\nTo reduce the risk of audits and double taxation, when transacting with their related parties, taxpayers should ensure the transfer price between them is arm’s length as if they were unrelated parties negotiating freely. Taxpayers should also maintain proper transfer pricing documentation to demonstrate that the pricing is arm’s length.\n\nIf taxpayers are faced with double taxation, they may apply for a mutual agreement procedure with their tax authorities under the DTA provisions to eliminate double taxation. They may also apply for an advance pricing arrangement to agree in advance with one or more tax authorities the appropriate transfer pricing for their related party transactions for a period of time.\n\nGlossary\n\nAdvance pricing arrangement\n\nThis is an arrangement between IRAS and the taxpayer or the relevant foreign competent authority to agree in advance an appropriate set of criteria to ascertain the transfer pricing for a taxpayer’s related party transactions for a specific period of time.\n\nArm’s length principle\n\nThe arm’s length principle is the international standard to guide transfer pricing. It requires the transaction with a related party to be made under comparable conditions and circumstances as a transaction with an independent party.\n\nArm’s length range\n\nA range of prices or margins that is acceptable for establishing that the conditions of a related party transaction are arm’s length.\n\nComparability analysis\n\nThe process of identifying economically relevant characteristics in a related party transaction and comparing such characteristics with those in independent party transactions. This involves an examination of the factors affecting the related party transaction that are non-existent in transactions between independent parties and vice-versa.\n\nComparable independent party transaction\n\nA comparable independent party transaction is a transaction between two independent parties that is comparable to the related party transaction under examination. It can be either a comparable transaction between one party which is a party to the related party transaction and two independent parties, neither of which is a party to the related party transaction (“external comparable”) or between independent party transactions (“internal comparable”).\n\nComparable uncontrolled price (“CUP”) method\n\nA transfer pricing method that compares the price for properties or services transferred in a related party transaction to the price charged for properties or services transferred in an independent party transaction in comparable circumstances.\n\nCompetent Authority\n\nThis refers to a person or an organisation that has been appointed or delegated to perform a designated function. IRAS is the designated competent authority for matters relating to transfer pricing, which include advance pricing arrangement and mutual agreement procedure.\n\nContribution analysis\n\nAn analysis used in the transactional profit split method under which the total profit earned by the parties from a related party transaction is divided based on the parties’ relative contributions to the earning of that profit.\n\nCorresponding adjustment\n\nWhen a tax authority increases a taxpayer’s taxable profits as a result of applying the arm’s length principle to the taxpayer’s transactions with its related party in another jurisdiction, double taxation arises if the same profits have been or will be included in the tax base of the related party. To eliminate the double taxation, the tax authority in the other jurisdiction may agree to reduce the taxable profits of that related party. Such a downward adjustment to the related party’s taxable profit is known as corresponding adjustment.\n\nCost plus method\n\nA transfer pricing method where a comparable gross mark up is added to the costs incurred by the supplier of goods or services in a related party transaction to arrive at the arm’s length price of that transaction.\n\nDirect costs\n\nCosts that are incurred specifically for producing a product or providing a service, such as the cost of raw materials.\n\nDouble taxation\n\nWhere two or more tax authorities take different positions in determining arm’s length prices, double taxation may occur. Double taxation means that the same income is included in the tax base by two or more tax authorities, but this does not always mean that the income will actually be taxed twice.\n\nDTA (or Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement)\n\nDTA refers to agreements between governments for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion of income taxes or commonly known as tax treaties.\n\nFAR\n\nFAR refers to Functions performed, Assets used and Risks assumed.\n\nFunctional analysis\n\nA functional analysis seeks to identify the economically significant activities and responsibilities undertaken, assets used or contributed, and risks assumed by the parties to the transactions.\n\nGross profits\n\nThe amount computed by deducting from the gross receipts of a business transaction the allocable purchases or production costs of sales, with due adjustment for increases or decreases in inventory or stock-in-trade, but without taking account of other expenses.\n\nIndependent parties (or unrelated parties)\n\nTwo parties are independent (or unrelated) parties with respect to each other if they are not related parties with respect to each other.\n\nIndependent (or unrelated) party transactions\n\nTransactions between independent (or unrelated) parties.\n\nIndirect costs\n\nCosts of producing a product or service which, although closely related to the production process, may be common to several products or services (for example, the costs of a repair department that services equipment used to produce different products).\n\nITA\n\nITA refers to the Income Tax Act 1947.\n\nMutual agreement procedure\n\nThis is a facility through which IRAS and the relevant foreign competent authority resolve disputes regarding the application of DTAs.\n\nNet profit indicator (or profit level indicator)\n\nThe ratio of net profit to an appropriate base (for example, costs, sales, assets) as used in the transactional net margin method.\n\nOECD TPG\n\nOECD TPG refers to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations.\n\nRelated party\n\nTwo persons are related parties with respect to each other if:\n\n(a) Either person, directly or indirectly, controls the other person; or\n\n(b) Both persons are, directly or indirectly, controlled by a common person.\n\nThe exact wordings of the definition are provided under Section 2 of the ITA.\n\nRelated party transactions\n\nTransactions between related parties.\n\nResale price margin\n\nA margin representing the amount out of which a reseller would seek to cover its selling and other operating expenses and, in the light of the functions performed (taking into account assets used and risks assumed), make an appropriate profit.\n\nResale price method\n\nA transfer pricing method where the resale price to the independent party is reduced by a comparable resale price margin to arrive at the arm’s length price of the product transferred between the related parties.\n\nResidual analysis\n\nAn analysis used in the transactional profit split method under which the total profit earned by the parties from a related party transaction is split in two stages: firstly, by determining the return for readily identifiable functions attributed to each party involved and secondly, by dividing the residual profit.\n\nSelf-initiated retrospective adjustments\n\nDue to subsequent changes in circumstances, some taxpayers may review their past transfer prices relating to the transactions with their related parties. Arising from such review, they may decide to make retrospective upward or downward adjustments for past financial years to arrive at what, in the taxpayers’ opinion, would be the arm’s length prices. These adjustments are referred to as self-initiated retrospective adjustments.\n\nTested party\n\nThe use of resale price method, cost plus method or transactional net margin method requires a decision on which party to apply the transfer pricing analysis. This party is known as the tested party. Generally, the tested party is the one where a transfer pricing method can be applied in the most reliable manner and most reliable comparables can be found.\n\nTP Documentation Rules\n\nTP Documentation Rules refers to the Income Tax (Transfer Pricing Documentation) Rules 2018.\n\nTraditional transaction methods\n\nTransfer pricing methods that compare the prices of related party transactions with those of transactions between independent parties, namely the comparable uncontrolled price method, the resale price method, and the cost plus method.\n\nTransactional net margin method (“TNMM”)\n\nA transfer pricing method that compares the net profit relative to an appropriate base (for example, costs, sales, assets) that is attained by a taxpayer from a related party transaction to that of comparable independent parties.\n\nTransactional profit methods\n\nTransfer pricing methods that compare the profits arising from related party transactions with those generated in independent party transactions, such as the transactional net margin method and transactional profit split method.\n\nTransactional profit split method\n\nA transfer pricing method that is based on the concept of splitting the combined profits of a transaction between related parties in a similar way as how independent parties would under comparable circumstances.\n\nTransfer pricing adjustment\n\nIn the event the related parties do not transact with each other at arm’s length prices, tax authorities may for tax purposes, substitute the price of the transaction with one that could have been charged if the parties were unrelated.

Such transactions can be sale or purchase of goods, provision of services, borrowing or lending of money, use or transfer of intangibles, etc.\n\nTwo persons are related parties with respect to each other if:\n\n(a) Either person, directly or indirectly, controls the other person; or\n\n(b) Both persons are, directly or indirectly, controlled by a common person.\n\nWhere a non-resident person carries on a business through a permanent establishment in Singapore, for the purpose of attributing profits to the permanent establishment:\n\n(a) The permanent establishment in Singapore of that person; and\n\n(b) Other permanent establishments outside Singapore of that person\n\nare treated as separate and distinct persons. They are considered related parties and accordingly the arm’s length principle applies to them when attributing profits to the permanent establishment in Singapore.\n\nWhen related parties transact with each other, their pricing may not reflect market conditions due to a lack of independence in their commercial and financial relations. As a result, their profits and tax liabilities may be distorted, especially when they are located in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. This creates concerns that the related parties may not be paying their fair share of tax and are able to derive a tax advantage as a group.\n\nTo ensure taxpayers transact with their related parties at pricing that reflects independent pricing, IRAS applies the internationally endorsed arm’s length principle. If taxpayers do not comply with the arm’s length principle and have understated their profits, IRAS will adjust their profits upwards as provided in the Income Tax Act 1947 (“ITA”).\n\nForeign tax authorities will likewise make upward adjustments when they find the transfer pricing of the cross-border related party transactions is not at arm’s length. Such transfer pricing adjustments, by IRAS or the foreign tax authorities, may lead to double taxation.\n\nThus, it is important that taxpayers comply with the arm’s length principle when transacting with their related parties and maintain proper transfer pricing documentation to substantiate their pricing.\n\nIRAS generally takes guidance from the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (“OECD TPG”).\n\nThe arm’s length principle\n\nIntroduction\n\nIRAS endorses the arm’s length principle as the standard to guide transfer pricing. IRAS subscribes to the principle that profits should be taxed where the real economic activities generating the profits are performed and where value is created. A proper application of the transfer pricing rules would ensure this outcome.\n\nThis section covers the following:\n\n(a) What the arm’s length principle is;\n\n(b) Basis for the arm’s length principle;\n\n(c) Reasons for endorsing the arm’s length principle;\n\n(d) Guiding principles on applying the arm’s length principle; and\n\n(e) Three-step approach to apply the arm’s length principle.\n\nWhat the arm’s length principle is\n\nThe arm’s length principle requires a transaction with a related party to be made under comparable conditions and circumstances as a transaction with an independent party. The premise is that where market forces drive the terms and conditions agreed in an independent party transaction, the pricing of the transaction would reflect the true economic value of the contributions made by each party in that transaction.\n\nTherefore, if two related parties derive profits at levels above or below the comparable market level solely because of their special relationship, the profits will be deemed as non-arm’s length. In such a case, IRAS can make necessary adjustments to the taxable profits of the taxpayer in Singapore. This is to reflect the true price that would be derived on an arm’s length basis.\n\nBasis for the arm’s length principle\n\nSection 34D of the ITA stipulates the use of the arm’s length principle for related party transactions, i.e. the conditions made or imposed between related parties with regard to their transaction are those conditions which would be made or imposed if they were not related parties and dealing independently with one another in comparable circumstances (“arm’s length conditions”).\n\nThe concept or use of the principle is also implied or referred to in various provisions of the ITA, including Sections 32 and 53.\n\nThe arm’s length principle is found in all of Singapore’s DTAs, typically in:\n\n(a) Paragraph 2 of the Business Profits Article\n\nWhen attributing profits in a contracting state/party to a permanent establishment in that state/party, the permanent establishment should be considered as “a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions”.\n\n(b) Paragraph 1 of the Associated Enterprises Article\n\n“Where…conditions are made or imposed between…two [associated] enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.”\n\nThe DTA requires the application of the arm’s length principle not only between associated enterprises but also between a permanent establishment of a person in Singapore and other permanent establishments of that person outside Singapore. The profits attributable to the permanent establishment in Singapore are the profits that the permanent establishment would have derived if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions.\n\nReasons for endorsing the arm’s length principle\n\nIRAS endorses the use of the arm’s length principle for two main reasons:\n\n(a) Market forces of supply and demand are the best way to allocate resources and reward effort. Applying the arm’s length principle would result in related and independent party transactions being treated equally for tax purposes.\n\n(b) Most tax jurisdictions adopt the arm’s length principle. In doing so, taxpayers and tax authorities will have a common basis to deal with related party transactions. This should reduce the incidence of transfer pricing adjustments and improve the resolution of transfer pricing disputes. Consequently, the likelihood of double taxation will be reduced.\n\nGuiding principles on applying the arm’s length principle\n\nIRAS recognises that the application of the arm’s length principle is not without difficulties. For instance:\n\n(a) Certain business structures and arrangements are complicated and unique, and may rarely be encountered between independent parties. The lack of comparable conditions established between independent parties makes it difficult to apply the arm’s length principle.\n\n(b) Establishing the arm’s length principle may require substantial analysis of large volume of data and information. Some information may not be readily available or may be of a confidential nature that cannot be disclosed without revealing business secrets.\n\n(c) It may also be costly for taxpayers to perform comprehensive analyses in applying the arm’s length principle and prepare sufficient documentation to demonstrate compliance with the arm’s length principle.\n\nTherefore, IRAS adopts the following guiding principles on applying the arm’s length principle:\n\n(a) Transfer pricing is not an exact science. Establishing and demonstrating compliance with the arm’s length principle require the exercise of judgment. Hence, a pragmatic approach would be adopted in ascertaining arm’s length pricing for related party transactions.\n\n(b) IRAS does not expect taxpayers to adhere rigidly to a defined set of rules in order to establish arm’s length pricing. Depending on the facts and circumstances, i.e. where there is a reasonable basis for doing so, taxpayers may determine and demonstrate arm’s length pricing using a different approach from those suggested in this e-Tax guide or complement those approaches suggested in this e-Tax guide.\n\n(c) Taxpayers would have intimate knowledge of the commercial circumstances that their businesses operate in and the economic relationships between various related parties. This puts them in a better position to perform a robust and comprehensive transfer pricing analysis to determine the arm’s length price.\n\n(d) Taxpayers should exert reasonable efforts to undertake a sound transfer pricing analysis. IRAS will consider the transfer prices determined as, prima facie, arm’s length when taxpayers have:\n\n• Applied the arm’s length principle in their analysis; and\n\n• Exercised reasonable efforts to comply with the arm’s length principle, i.e. the transfer prices may reasonably be considered to approximate to arm’s length prices.\n\n(e) IRAS welcomes taxpayers to discuss their concerns and difficulties in applying the arm’s length principle. IRAS believes that such consultation and cooperation between taxpayers and IRAS is a mutually beneficial and pragmatic way to assist taxpayers in complying with the arm’s length principle.\n\nThree-step approach to apply the arm’s length principle\n\nIRAS recommends that taxpayers adopt the following three-step approach to apply the arm’s length principle in their related party transactions:\n\nStep 1 - Conduct comparability analysis\n\nStep 2 - Identify the most appropriate transfer pricing method and tested party\n\nStep 3 - Determine the arm’s length results\n\nTransfer pricing analysis always requires an element of judgment. Ultimately, the main objective in any transfer pricing analysis is to present a logical, coherent and consistent basis to demonstrate that transfer prices set between related parties are at arm’s length.\n\nThe recommended three-step approach is neither mandatory nor prescriptive. A taxpayer can modify the recommended approach or adopt an alternative approach if its individual circumstances require such modifications to better arrive at the arm’s length result.\n\nStep 1 – Conduct comparability analysis\n\nComparability analysis is at the heart of the application of the arm’s length principle. This requires:\n\n(a) Identifying the commercial or financial relations between the related parties and the conditions and economically relevant circumstances attaching to those relations in order that the transaction between the related parties is accurately delineated.\n\n(b) Comparing the conditions and relevant circumstances of the related party transaction as accurately delineated with the conditions and the economically relevant circumstances of comparable transactions between independent parties.\n\nThe comparability analysis conducted under Step 1 will have:\n\n(a) Set out the factual substance of the commercial or financial relations between the related parties and accurately delineated the actual transaction;\n\n(b) Compared the economically relevant characteristics of the actual related party transaction and independent party transactions;\n\n(c) Identified the differences (if any) in the economically relevant characteristics between the related party transaction and the independent party transactions that can materially affect the price of the related party transaction; and\n\n(d) Determined reasonably accurate adjustments that can be made to eliminate the effect of any such differences.\n\nIdentifying the actual related party transaction\n\nThe process of identifying the commercial or financial relations between the related parties and the conditions and economically relevant circumstances attaching to those relations requires:\n\n(a) A broad understanding of the industry sector in which the group operates.\n\n(b) An analysis of what each party does and their commercial or financial relations as expressed in the transaction or transactions between them.\n\n(c) The accurate delineation of the actual transaction or transactions between them.\n\nThe accurate delineation of the actual transaction between the related parties requires establishing the economically relevant characteristics of the transaction. Such characteristics consist of the conditions of the transaction and the circumstances in which the transaction takes place. They can be broadly categorised as:\n\n(a) The contractual terms of the transaction;\n\n(b) The characteristics of goods sold or purchased, services received or provided, or intangible properties used or transferred;\n\n(c) The functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the parties; and\n\n(d) The commercial and economic circumstances of the parties.\n\nContractual terms of the transaction\n\nA transaction is the consequence of the commercial or financial relations between the related parties.\n\nWhere a transaction has been formalised by the related parties through written contractual agreements, those agreements provide the starting point for delineating the transaction between them, how the transaction is priced and how the responsibilities and risks arising from their interaction are to be divided between them at the time of entering into the agreements.\n\nWritten contractual agreements alone may not provide all the information necessary to perform a transfer pricing analysis, or to provide sufficient information regarding the contractual terms.\n\nFurther information will be required by taking into consideration the analysis of the other economically relevant characteristics mentioned in paragraphs 5.18(b) to (d). Taken together, the analysis provides evidence of the actual conduct of the related parties with regard to the transaction.\n\nWhere conduct is not fully consistent with the contractual terms, further analysis is required to identify the actual transaction.\n\nWhere there are material differences between the contractual terms and the actual conduct of the related parties, the actual transaction should be determined from the actual conduct.\n\nExample:\n\n• Parent Co in Country P has a distribution agreement with its subsidiary, Sub Co, in Country S.\n\n• Under the distribution agreement, Sub Co is to distribute Parent Co’s products and to conduct marketing activities in Country S.\n\n• Based on an analysis of the other economically relevant characteristics mentioned in paragraphs 5.18(b) to (d), it was determined that:\n\no All marketing activities are undertaken by Parent Co, i.e. full responsibility lies with Parent Co.\n\no Sub Co does not have the capability to perform marketing activities.\n\no Sub Co merely distributes the products without performing any marketing activities or incurring any costs relating to such activities.\n\n• Based on the actual conduct of Parent Co and Sub Co, it can be concluded that the written agreement does not reflect the actual conduct of the parties.\n\n• Thus, the identification of the actual transaction between Parent Co and Sub Co should not be based solely on the written agreement but should be determined from their actual conduct.\n\nWhere there is no written contractual agreement between the related parties, all aspects of the arrangement would need to be deduced from available evidence of the actual conduct of the parties. This includes the functions that are actually performed, the assets that are actually used or contributed and the risks actually assumed by the parties.\n\nCharacteristics of goods, services or intangible properties\n\nThe specific characteristics of goods, services or intangible properties play a significant part in determining their values in the open market. For instance, a product with better quality and more features would, all other things being equal, fetch a higher selling price. In other words, product or service differentiation affects the price or value of the product or service.\n\nThe nature and features of goods, intangible properties or services transacted between related parties and those between independent parties must be examined carefully. Similarities and differences should be identified as these would influence their value.\n\nImportant characteristics to be examined include:\n\nNature of transaction\n\nPossible comparisons\n\nTransfer of goods\n\n• Physical features\n• Quality and reliability\n• Availability and volume of supply\n\nProvision of services\n\nNature and extent of the services\n\nIntangible properties\n\n• Form of transaction\n• Type and nature of the intangible property\n• Duration and extent of rights provided by the intangible property\n• Anticipated benefits from the use of the intangible property\n\nIf the comparable uncontrolled price (“CUP”) method is chosen as the most appropriate transfer pricing method (see Step 2 below), ensuring similarities in the actual characteristics of the product, intangible or service would be the most critical when conducting a comparability analysis.\n\nOn the other hand, comparisons of profit margins (as used in transfer pricing methods other than CUP) may be less sensitive to the characteristics of the product or service in question. This is because the margins generally correlate more significantly with the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the taxpayer.\n\nFunctional analysis on Functions performed, Assets used and Risks assumed (“FAR”)\n\nIn transactions between two independent parties, compensation will usually reflect the functions that each enterprise performs, taking into account assets used and risks assumed. The same principle applies to transactions between related parties. Hence, a crucial step in comparability analysis is to conduct a “functional analysis” to delineate the related party transaction and determine comparability between the related party transaction and the independent party transactions.\n\nA functional analysis seeks to identify the economically significant activities and responsibilities undertaken, assets used or contributed, and risks assumed by the parties to the transactions.\n\nThe analysis focuses on what the parties actually do and the capabilities they provide. Such activities and capabilities will include decision-making. For example, decisions about business strategy and risks.\n\nThe analysis also considers the type of assets used (such as plant and equipment, valuable intangibles, financial assets, etc.) and the nature of the assets used (such as the age, market value, location, property right protections available, etc.)\n\nIdentifying risks goes hand in hand with identifying functions and assets. Risks are the effect of uncertainty on the objectives of the business. The actual assumption of risks by a taxpayer to a transaction can significantly affect the pricing of that transaction at arm’s length. Thus, when analysing risks, taxpayers should observe:\n\n(a) The effect of the risks assumed may not be apparent in the financial statements. This does not mean that the risks do not exist but it can be that the risks have been effectively managed. Therefore, taxpayer should conduct thorough functional analysis to determine what risks have been assumed, what functions are performed that relate to or affect the assumption or impact of these risks and which party or parties to the transaction assume these risks.\n\n(b) The pricing of the actual transaction should take into account the financial and other consequences of risk assumption and the remuneration for risk management. A taxpayer who assumes a risk is entitled to the upside benefits and incurs the downside costs. A taxpayer who assumes and mitigates the risk will be entitled to a greater remuneration than a taxpayer who only assumes or only mitigates the risk and does not do both.\n\n(c) To assume a risk for transfer pricing purposes, the taxpayer needs to control the risk and has the financial capacity to assume the risk.\n\nExamples:\n\n• If taxpayer claims that it assumes credit risk when customers default on payments, it would need to demonstrate that it has:\no The financial capacity to assume the risk (such as availability of credit lines from banks),\no The capability and authority to decide to take on, lay off or decline the risk-bearing opportunity, together with the actual performance of that decision-making function, (such as whether or not to sell the product to the customer or whether or not to sell on credit to customer), and\no The capability and authority to decide whether and how to respond to the risk (such as taking legal action to recover the debt).\nTaxpayer may outsource its day-to-day mitigation activities, such as credit risk analysis. However, it has to demonstrate that it has the capability to determine the objective of outsourcing the credit risk analysis, who it wants to hire to perform the credit risk analysis, etc.\n\n• If taxpayer claims that it assumes inventory obsolescence risk, it would need to demonstrate that it has:\no The financial capacity to assume the risk,\no The capability and authority to decide to take on, lay off or decline the risk (such as whether or not to sell a slow-moving product), and\no The capability and authority to decide whether and how to respond to the risk (such as conducting marketing campaigns to boost ailing sales or employing a diversification strategy).\n\nTheoretically, the level of return derived by a taxpayer should be directly correlated to the FAR. For instance, a taxpayer selling a product with warranty should earn a higher return compared to another taxpayer selling the same product without the warranty. The difference in margin is due to the additional function performed and risk assumed by the first taxpayer. Likewise, a product with a reputable branding is expected to fetch a higher return compared to that of a similar product without the branding. This is due to the additional asset (in this case, trademark) employed in enhancing the value of the product.\n\nThe example below illustrates that arm’s length compensation should reflect the outcome of a functional analysis.\n\nExample:\n\n• Company A is in the business of distributing general household electrical products in the Asia Pacific (“APAC”) region. Company A purchases these products from its parent company.\n\n• Company A conducted a thorough functional analysis which revealed:\n\nFAR\n\nDetails\n\nFunctions Besides distributing the products in the APAC region, Company A undertakes certain functions for the APAC region which include:\n• Setting and managing all marketing strategies and campaigns\n• Conducting market intelligence\n• Analysing consumer demand and the actions of its competitors\n• Determining volume to be sold\n• Setting prices for the products to be sold\n• Conducting credit analysis of customers\n\nAssets\n\nCompany A owns and operates a warehouse to store the products. To ensure orders are processed quickly and to control the inventory level of slow-moving products, Company A utilises a self-inventory management developed automated system to track and process inventories and shipping orders for the APAC region.\n\nRisks\n\nCompany A demonstrated that it assumes credit risk and inventory obsolescence risk as in the examples in paragraph 5.35(c).\n\n• The arm’s length remuneration for Company A should reflect the distribution function as well as the above functions performed, assets used and risks assumed. The level of remuneration for Company A would be higher compared to another company, Company B, that merely distributes products while the above functions, assets and risks remained with Company B’s parent company.\n\nCommercial and economic circumstances\n\nComparability analysis should take into account the commercial and economic circumstances in which the related and independent parties operate.\n\nPrices may vary across different markets even for transactions involving the same property or services. In order to make meaningful comparisons between related party transactions and independent party transactions with regard to their prices or margins, the markets and economic circumstances in which the parties operate or where the transactions are undertaken should be comparable. Such comparisons include:\n\nCircumstances\n\nEconomic circumstances\n\nPossible comparisons\n\n• Availability of substitute goods or services\n• Geographic location\n• Market size\n• Extent of competition in the markets\n• Consumer purchasing power\n• Level of taxpayers in the market at which they operate (for wholesale or retail)\n\nGovernment policies and regulations\n\n• Price controls\n• National insurance\n\nBusiness strategies\n\n• Innovation development and new product\n• Degree of diversification\n• Risk aversion\n• Assessment of political changes\n• Duration of arrangements\n• Other factors bearing upon the daily conduct of business\n\nComparing actual related party transaction with independent party transactions\n\nThe economically relevant characteristics of the actual related party transaction have to be compared with those of independent party transactions in order to determine an arm’s length price for the related party transaction.\n\nWhen making the comparison, these other aspects of comparability analysis are relevant:\n\n(a) Evaluating transactions on a separate or aggregate basis;\n\n(b) Using multiple year data;\n\n(c) Considering losses; and\n\n(d) Selecting comparables.\n\nEvaluating transactions on a separate or aggregate basis\n\nGenerally, the arm’s length principle should be applied on a transaction-by-transaction basis to obtain the most precise approximation of arm’s length conditions.\n\nHowever, where individual transactions are highly inter-related and it can be demonstrated that independent parties in comparable circumstances would typically price the individual transactions on an aggregate basis, taxpayers may consider evaluating the transactions on an aggregate basis.\n\nUsing multiple year data\n\nTo enhance the reliability of the comparability analysis, taxpayers should examine multiple year data as opposed to single year data. Multiple year data helps to identify factors that may have influenced or should have influenced transfer prices, such as long term arrangements and business or product life cycles.\n\nConsidering losses\n\nGenerally, businesses exist with the objective to generate profits. Therefore, a taxpayer transacting with a related party at a loss indicates that the taxpayer may not be compensated at arm’s length.\n\nSimilar to independent parties, a taxpayer transacting with a related party may sustain genuine losses for various reasons such as heavy start-up costs, unfavourable economic conditions, inefficiencies, market penetration business strategy, etc. If so, the claim should be supported with evidence that an independent party would likewise incur losses for a similar period under similar commercial and economic circumstances.\n\nSelecting comparables\n\nA sound comparability analysis requires the selection of reliable comparables. Generally, this is performed prior to or at the time of the related party transactions. These could be either internal or external comparables:\n\nComparables\n\nInternal\n\nCharacteristics\n\nPrice or margin in a comparable transaction between one party which is a party to the related party transaction and an independent party.\n\nExternal\n\nPrice or margin in a comparable transaction between two independent parties, neither of which is a party to the related party transaction.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates internal and external comparables:\n\nComparable circumstances\n\nrelated party transaction\n\nA (taxpayer)\n\nB (related party)\n\nindependent party transaction (internal comparable)\n\nC (independent party)\n\nindependent party transaction (external comparable)\n\nD (independent party)\n\nGenerally, internal comparables may have a more direct and closer relationship to the transaction under review compared to external comparables. Hence, they are preferred because the financial analysis typically would be based on similar accounting standards and information on the comparable transactions would be readily available and more reliable.\n\nInternal comparables may not always be more comparable than external comparables. For example, a taxpayer may sell a significant volume of products to its foreign related party and a much smaller volume to an independent party. The difference in sales volumes is likely to materially affect the comparability of the two transactions. In this case, it may be necessary to search for external comparables that are more comparable.\n\nWhen selecting external comparables, taxpayers should consider the following:\n\n(a) Commercial databases\n\nIRAS does not have a preference for any particular commercial database as long as it provides a reliable source of information that assists taxpayers in performing comparability analysis. Whichever database the taxpayer chooses, transfer pricing documentation should be maintained to demonstrate the results of its comparability analysis.\n\n(b) Comparables with publicly available information\n\nTaxpayers should only use comparables with publicly available information. Such information can be readily obtained from various sources and verified, making the analyses of these comparables more reliable compared to those based on privately held information.\n\nBetween a company that is listed on a stock exchange and one that is not listed, IRAS prefers the former as a comparable because there is generally more information available in the public domain compared to the latter.\n\n(c) Non-local comparables\n\nAs far as possible, taxpayers should use local comparables in their comparability analysis. Generally, these comparables have a higher degree of comparability in terms of their market and economic circumstances compared to non-local comparables. When taxpayers are unable to find sufficiently reliable local comparables, they may expand their search to regional comparables.\n\n(d) Loss-generating comparables\n\nIn conducting their comparability analysis, taxpayers may come across independent parties which have sustained losses over a period of time. If other independent parties have generated profits for a similar period under similar commercial and economic circumstances, the question arises whether the transactions of the loss-making parties are truly reflective of normal business conditions. The persistently loss-making independent parties are therefore likely to be less reliable comparables. Under such circumstances, taxpayers should exclude as comparables independent parties with the following financial results:\n\n• Weighted average loss for the tested period; or\n\n• Loss incurred for more than half of the tested period.\n\nWhere there are differences between the economically relevant characteristics of the actual related party transaction and independent party transactions, it is important to consider whether there is comparability between the transactions and what adjustments may be necessary to achieve comparability.\n\nDesired outcome of Step 1\n\nThe aim of the comparability analysis is a comprehensive assessment and identification of significant similarities and differences (such as product characteristics, functions performed, etc.) between the taxpayers or transactions in question and those entities or transactions to be benchmarked against.\n\nWhere reasonably accurate adjustments could be made for material differences identified, the method of making or computing such adjustments should be documented.\n\nA thorough understanding of the level of comparability is necessary in deciding the choice of transfer pricing method and tested party (see Step 2 below).\n\nStep 2 – Identify the most appropriate transfer pricing method and tested party\n\nThere are five internationally accepted methods for evaluating a taxpayer’s transfer prices or margins against a benchmark based on the prices or margins adopted by independent parties in similar transactions.\n\nThese five methods can be categorised as follows:\n\nTraditional transaction methods Transactional profits methods\n\n• CUP method\n• Resale price method\n• Cost plus method\n\n• Transactional profit split method\n• Transactional net margin method (“TNMM”)\n\nTraditional transaction methods compare the price of related party transactions with that of transactions between independent parties. On the other hand, transactional profits methods compare the profit arising from related party transactions with that generated in independent party transactions.\n\nCUP method\n\nThe CUP method compares the following two prices:\n\n(a) The price charged for properties or services transferred in a related party transaction; and\n\n(b) The price charged for properties or services transferred in an independent party transaction in comparable circumstances.\n\nA difference between the two prices above may suggest that the related parties are not dealing at arm’s length. Therefore, the price in the related party transaction may need to be substituted with the price in the independent party transaction.\n\nThe price or value of a property or service is very sensitive to differing characteristics, functions performed and market conditions, etc. Hence, the CUP method is reliable only if:\n\n(a) There is high level of comparability between the related party transaction and the independent party transaction; or\n\n(b) Reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the effects of material differences.\n\nAs the CUP method is the most direct way to determine arm’s length price, it should generally be preferred to the other methods. However, a less direct method is necessary if comparable independent party transactions cannot be found or where reasonably accurate adjustments for differences in comparability cannot be made.\n\nThe CUP method is most suitable to evaluate transactions involving products with very similar characteristics (in terms of type, physical features, quality and quantity transacted, etc.) and undertaken in similar market or economic conditions, such as widely traded commodities. As there should not be much product differentiation for the use of the CUP method, similarities in product characteristics and market or economic conditions are much more significant considerations than the FAR of the taxpayers in determining the suitability of the CUP method.\n\nTaxpayers should rely on internal comparables as far as possible. External comparables may be used if no reliable internal comparable transactions exist. Example 1 and Example 2 in Annex A illustrate the use of an “internal CUP” and an “external CUP” respectively.\n\nResale price method\n\nThe resale price method is applied where a product that has been purchased from a related party is resold to an independent party. Essentially, it values the functions performed by the “reseller” of a product.\n\nIn this method, the resale price to the independent party is reduced by a comparable gross margin (the “resale price margin”) to arrive at the arm’s length price of the product transferred between the related parties.\n\nUnder arm’s length conditions, the resale price margin should allow the reseller to recover its selling and operating costs, and earn a reasonable profit based on its FAR.\n\nAs gross profit margins represent the gross compensation (after cost of sales) for specific FAR, product differences are less critical than under the CUP method. Therefore, where the related and independent party transactions are comparable in all aspects except the product, the resale price method may be more reliable than the CUP method. Nonetheless, the more comparable the products, the more likely the resale price method will produce better results.\n\nIf there are material differences that affect the resale price margin earned in the related and independent party transactions, adjustments should be made to eliminate the effects of those differences.\n\nThe resale price method is most appropriate where the reseller adds relatively little value to the properties. The more value the reseller adds to the properties (for example, via complicated processing or assembly with other products), the harder it is to apply the resale price method. This is especially so where the reseller contributes significantly to creating or maintaining intangible properties, such as trademarks or trade names, in its activities.\n\nTaxpayers should rely on internal comparables as far as possible. External comparables may be used if no reliable internal comparable transactions exist. Example 3 in Annex A illustrates the use of the resale price method.\n\nCost plus method\n\nThe cost plus method focuses on the gross mark up obtained by a supplier for property transferred or services provided to a related purchaser. Essentially, it values the functions performed by the supplier of the property or services.\n\nIn this method, a comparable gross mark up is added to the costs of the supplier of goods or services (“cost base”) in the related party transaction to arrive at the arm’s length price of that transaction.\n\nSimilar to the resale price method, fewer adjustments may be necessary to account for product differences compared to the CUP method. It may be appropriate to focus on other factors of comparability, such as the FAR and economic circumstances of the tested party and the comparable entities.\n\nApplying the cost plus method requires the comparability of the gross mark up and cost base in the related and independent party transactions. If the related and independent party transactions are not comparable in all aspects and the differences have a material effect on the price or margin, adjustments should be made to eliminate the effects of those differences.\n\nGenerally, costs can be classified as follows:\n\nType of cost\n\nDirect costs\n\nIndirect costs\n\nExamples\n\n• Cost of raw materials\n• Cost of labour\n\n• Depreciation\n• Repair and maintenance which may be allocated among several products\n\nOperating expenses\n\n• Marketing\n• General and administrative\n\nIn applying the cost plus method, direct and indirect costs of producing a good or providing a service are normally used to compute the cost base. Such costs are limited to the costs of the supplier of goods or services and should take into account an analysis of the supplier’s FAR. The methods of determining the cost base should be consistent over time.\n\nIf the supplier of goods or services is the tested party and is a taxpayer in Singapore, the cost base should be determined according to the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards. Where necessary, adjustments will be made to ensure the cost base is arm’s length. This means that the cost base may include costs not reflected in the tested party’s accounts.\n\nExample:\n\n• Company A provides services to its related party, Company B.\n• Company B bore certain cost of $100,000 for the benefit of Company A and related to the services provided by A.\n• Company B did not allocate the $100,000 to Company A.\n• Based on an analysis of FAR of Company A and Company B, the $100,000 should be allocated to Company A.\n• In determining the cost base for the services provided to Company B, the cost base will be adjusted to include the $100,000 even though this amount has not been allocated to Company A and is not reflected in its accounts.\n\nTransactional profit split method (residual analysis approach)\n\nThe transactional profit split method is based on the concept of splitting the combined profits of a transaction between related parties in a similar way as how independent parties would under comparable circumstances.\n\nExample:\n\n• Company A is a Singapore manufacturing and sales company for telecommunication products. It developed an original microprocessor and holds the patent for the manufacturing technology. Company F, an overseas subsidiary of SingCo, develops and manufactures mobile equipment using the new microprocessor as well as technology developed by itself.\n\n• Company F is the only manufacturer licensed by SingCo to use the new microprocessor. SingCo purchases all of the mobile equipment manufactured by Company F and sells them to third parties.\n\n• Both companies contribute to the success of the mobile equipment through their design of the microprocessor and the equipment. As the nature of the products is very advanced and unique, the group is unable to locate any comparable with similar intangible assets. Therefore, neither the traditional methods nor the TNMM is appropriate in this case.\n\n• Nevertheless, the group is able to obtain reliable data on handphone contract manufacturers and equipment wholesalers without unique intangible property in the telecommunication industry. The manufacturers earn a mark up of 10% while the wholesalers derive a 25% margin on sales.\n\n• SingCo’s and Company F’s respective share of profit is determined in two stages using the transactional profit split method (residual analysis approach).\n\nStage 1 – Determining the return for routine contributions\n\nThe simplified accounts of SingCo and Company F are shown below:\n\nCompany F (S$)\n\nSingCo (S$)\n\nSales\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nGross Margin\n\nSales, General & Admin\n\nOperating Margin\n\n100\n\n(60)\n\n40\n\n(5)\n\n35\n\nThe total operating profit for the group is S$45.\n\nCompany F\n\nCost of goods sold\n\nCost mark up of contract manufacturer (10% x S$60)\n\nTransfer price based on comparables (without intangibles)\n\n125\n\n(100)\n\n25\n\n(15)\n\n10\n\nS$60\n\nS$6\n\nS$66\n\nSingCo\n\nSales to third party customers\n\nS$125\n\nResale margin of wholesalers comparables (without intangibles) 25%\n\nS$31.25\n\nResale margin (or gross margin)\n\nComputation of return for routine contributions based on comparables (without intangibles):\n\nCompany F (S$)\n\nSingCo (S$)\n\nSales\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nGross Margin\n\nSales, General & Admin\n\nRoutine operating margin\n\n66\n\n(60)\n\n6\n\n(5)\n\n1\n\nThe total operating margin of the group is S$17.25.\n\n31.25\n\n(15.00)\n\n16.25\n\nStage 2: Dividing the residual profit\n\nThe residual profit of the group = S$45 – S$17.25 = S$27.75\n\nOn further study of the two companies, two particular expense items, research and development (“R&D”) expenses and marketing expenses, are identified as contributing to the key intangibles critical to the success of the mobile equipment. The R&D expenses and marketing expenses incurred by each company are as follows:\n\nSingCo\n\nCompany F\n\nS$12 (80%)\n\nS$3 (20%)\n\nAssuming that the R&D and marketing expenses are equally significant in contributing to the residual profit, based on the proportionate expenses incurred:\n\nSingCo’s share of residual profit (80% x S$27.75)\n\nCompany F’s share of residual profit (20% x S$27.75)\n\nS$22.20\n\nS$5.55\n\nTherefore, the adjusted operating profits of each company are as follows:\n\nSingCo\n\nCompany F\n\n= S$5.55 + S$1\n\n= S$22.20 + S$16.25 = S$38.45\n\nThe adjusted tax accounts are as follows:\n\nSales\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nGross Margin\n\nSales, General & Admin\n\nOperating Margin\n\nCompany F (S$)\n\nSingCo (S$)\n\n71.55\n\n(60.00)\n\n11.55\n\n(5.00)\n\n6.55\n\n125.00\n\n(71.55)\n\n53.45\n\n(15.00)\n\n38.45\n\nHence, the transfer price determined using the transactional profit split method (residual analysis approach) should be S$71.55.\n\nExample 6: Transactional net margin method\n\nSingCo is a Singapore manufacturer of dishwashers. All of SingCo’s dishwashers are sold to an overseas related party, Company G, and bear Company G’s brand. Company G, a household electrical appliances brand name, sells only dishwashers manufactured by SingCo.\n\nThe CUP method is not applied in this case because no reliable adjustments can be made to account for differences with similar products in the market.\n\nAfter the appropriate functional analysis, SingCo was able to identify a Singapore manufacturer of home electrical appliances, Company H, as a suitable comparable company. However, Company H performs warranty functions for its independent wholesalers, whereas SingCo does not. Company H realizes a net mark up or operating margin of 10%.\n\nAs the costs pertaining to the warranty functions cannot be separately identified in Company H’s accounts and no reliable adjustments can be made to account for the difference in the functions, it may be more reliable to examine the net margins in this case. The transfer price for SingCo’s sale of dishwashers to Company G is computed using the TNMM as follows:\n\nSingCo’s cost of goods sold\n\nSingCo’s operating expenses\n\nTotal costs\n\nAdd: Net mark up (10% x S$6,500)\n\nTransfer price based on TNMM\n\nS$5,000\n\nS$1,500\n\nS$6,500\n\nS$650\n\nS$7,150\n\nANNEX B – Samples and guides for MAP and APA process\n\nAnnex B1: Sample of letter of authorisation\n\nNote: The letter is to be printed on the taxpayer’s letterhead\n\n[Date]\n\nInternational Tax and Relations Division\nTransfer Pricing and Dispute Resolution Branch\nInland Revenue Authority of Singapore\n55 Newton Road\nSingapore 307987\n\nAttention: [IRAS Case Officer]\n\nLETTER OF AUTHORITY- APPLICATION FOR *[MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE (“MAP”)/ BILATERAL ADVANCE PRICING ARRANGEMENT (“BAPA”)/ UNILATERAL ADVANCE PRICING ARRANGEMENT (“UAPA”)] BY [NAME(S) OF TAXPAYER(S)]\n\nDear Sir/ Madam,\n\nThis is to advise that we have appointed [Tax agent/ representative (Name and contact information)] to represent us on all matters relating to the above application.
